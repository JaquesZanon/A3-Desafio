The greatest \"shortcoming\" is that the book is over 50 years old. The heroine is the vice-president of a major railroad company, and most of the plot revolves around her desperate efforts to keep the railroad going. In the 21st century, when the age of railroads is long past, this is certainly dated. Indeed, Atlas Shrugged, although contemporary when written, takes on the feel of a grand masterful allegory perhaps like Dante, Chaucer, or Swift. It is just as much \"fun\" as Alice in Wonderland or Gulliver's Travels--and just as serious as the Divine Comedy. Yet, if you listen to a hour of local and national news on TV every evening while reading the book--half of the stories will sound as though they were lifted from the book--so timelessness and universal is Rand's story.This will probably be the most important book (to you) that you read in your lifetime.What is it about? It is often described as \"Capitalism versus Communism\", or \"altruism vs selfishness\"--but both descriptions seriously miss the point. What this book is really about is much more fundamental. It is about the nature of good and evil, and beyond that, the very meaning of life.\"But I'm a good person, so what value is this book to me?\"--you may ask. Answer: You have certainly noticed that adult \"morality\" is full of all kinds of exceptions and contradictions. The truth is, the world of \"morality\" we adults have constructed is a sham, a fraud. It is no more than \"social convention\"--which is to say, \"what we all more-or-less agree to\"--and actually, despite all the \"moral\" justification, has absolutely nothing to do with morality or right-and-wrong, and often little to do with common sense.Still, the question remains, \"Why isn't simply accepting the current 'social norms' good enough?\" \"Go along to get along.\" Answer: To put it bluntly, the greatest evil the world has ever seen has been done by folks \"accepting community norms\" who thought they were doing good, or at least who could justify their actions as being \"socially acceptable\".The truth is, you will be quite surprised when you learn the true nature of evil. Until you have read Atlas Shrugged, evil will remain a hazy mist floating just off your line of vision, which you don't look straight at, because you don't WANT it to exist. After reading Atlas Shrugged, evil snaps into sharp focus--and like a bully confronted--ceases to be a fear, and just becomes something distasteful to avoid.As Rand richly illustrates: Just as eating too much fat can clog up your arteries, thinking \"too much fat\" can damage with your mental health. Some mental illness is physiological. But most mental illness is caused by unresolved internal contradictions--caused, for example, by refusing to look at evil because you PREFER to believe that it does not exist. Reality is. You do NOT have the option of living in your own private version of reality. Nevertheless, many, perhaps most, people live lives built on thier own complex lies. That turns smart people crazy, and stupid people mean and crazy.How do you avoid \"unresolved internal contradictions\"? By knowing the difference between right and wrong, and never, ever, allowing a rotten board to be used in the construction of your mental house. The problem is the old \"slippery slope\". Lie to yourself just once, no matter how trivial the lie, and the next one will be easier. Before long, you realize that you can justify ANYTHING--and with the blessings of the popular culture. And before you know it, you've lost your soul.As Rand preaches, the meaning of life is integrity. Living without compromise. To live a life filled with joy and pride in yourself, made possible by being free of mental conflicts. To know, not merely hope, that your mistakes were honest mistakes. To live with the knowledge that you are the best you can be, while striving to be better. To be a joy and comfort to the people you love. To give generously of your time, wealth, and love simply for the joy of doing so. To be a person who has changed the world for the better when you have gone. That's what Atlas Shrugged is really all about. All ofthe other themes, even Communism vs Capitalism are peripheral supporting themes. It is precisely because the fundamental issues are so basic and primary, that the implications are simultaneously universal--applying to all aspects of life.The greatest real flaw in Atlas Shrugged is that Rand herself does not quite understand how her philosophy applies to inter-personal relationships. All of the heros in the story are flawed characters, because Rand's characters are based on herself, and are flawed because Rand herself was flawed. That is, Rand had such a horrible youth that her ability to love and trust was damaged. In her own flawed vision, she has largely substituted hero worship for love. Rand's heros are real heros to be admired, but not role models to emulate.You will also find many things with which you will want to disagree, but in your heart, you will know that Rand is right. How you resolve these conflicts will be the most important decision you will make in your entire life. If you choose the truth, simply because it is the truth, then you are on the way to a life of good mental health. If you reject the truth because you PREFER a different vision or interpretation of reality--then you have already begun to lie to yourself, and you will probably have an unhappy life and be a miserable person to live with.\"}"}]}

In this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons. The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife.

Dodging minefields in Cambodia, diving into the icy waters outside a Russian bath, Chef Bourdain travels the world over in search of the ultimate meal. The only thing Anthony Bourdain loves as much as cooking is traveling, and A Cook's Tour is the shotgun marriage of his two greatest passions. Inspired by the question, 'What would be the perfect meal?', Anthony sets out on a quest for his culinary holy grail. Our adventurous chef starts out in Japan, where he eats traditional Fugu, a poisonous blowfish which can be prepared only by specially licensed chefs. He then travels to Cambodia, up the mine-studded road to Pailin into autonomous Khmer Rouge territory and to Phnom Penh's Gun Club, where local fare is served up alongside a menu of available firearms. In Saigon, he's treated to a sustaining meal of live Cobra heart before moving on to savor a snack with the Viet Cong in the Mecong Delta. Further west, Kitchen Confidential fans will recognize the Gironde of Tony's youth, the first stop on his European itinerary. And from France, it's on to Portugal, where an entire village has been fattening a pig for months in anticipation of his arrival. And we're only halfway around the globe. . . A Cook's Tour recounts, in Bourdain's inimitable style, the adventures and misadventures of America's favorite chef.\", \"authors\": \"['Anthony Bourdain']\", \"publisher\" : \"Bloomsbury Publishing USA\", \"text\" : \"One of the things that sets Tony Bourdain apart from the (other?) celeb chefs on the food-themed cable networks is that he's about the only one who will come right out and tell us when something doesn't taste good. All the others grin and rave about whatever gets placed in front of them. But Tony isn't afraid to tell us, \"that's the most disgusting thing I've eaten in my entire life.\" That's why we love him.Of course, unlike most of the TV chefs, Tony puts himself in positions where he has to eat disgusting things. That's the basic theme of this book, and he carries it off really well. Well beyond the \"don't eat fish on Mondays\" and \"watch out for the hollandaise\" revelations of \"Kitchen Confidential,\" \"A Cook's Tour\" isn't just a good book-about-food, it's a very good book in its own right. Tony might not value (or appreciate) the comparison to P.J. O'Rourke's \"Holidays in Hell,\" but as writers who can take awful places and experiences and make them downright funny to read about, these two have a lot in common.I noted in my review of \"Kitchen Confidential\" that Tony's life was probably a lot more fun to read about than to have lived through (he might not agree with that), and that goes double for this title. Some of what Tony describes here is a little -- or more than a little -- squirm-inducing, while his travelogue of the road to Pailin was downright harrowing. Sensitive readers (as Miss Manners might say) should be aware that there are at least two graphic descriptions of the death of an animal intended for the cookpot -- though as he notes in his excellent section on his dinner with a bunch of vegans, not all killing is \"murder,\" and vegetarianism is a luxury of rich societies. People on the edge of survival literally can't afford to pass on the chicken strutting around their yard in order to await the arrival of expensive and out-of-season veggies.Some critics have accused Tony of hypocrisy (or selling out) for having a TV show on the Food Network tied into this book when in the past he's said some fairly nasty things about celebrity TV chefs. But the filming of the TV program actually plays an interesting role in his book -- with Tony somewhat undermining his own program by revealing how often what's shown on screen differs substantially from his actual experience in a given location.The chapter on \"The Road to Pailin\" -- a section in which food itself barely plays a role -- especially reveals Tony's chops as a writer. But other chapters, especially those on Southeast Asia, are quite well done too. I really enjoyed reading this, and if Tony chooses to put himself in harm's way again, you can be sure I'll be there to read about it.\"}"}]}

He brings life to characters in otherwise drab situations and makes them seem very real. The reader feels the frustration, absurdity, the pettiness and the powerlessness in a personal way. You feel the haughtiness and aloofness of the Castle staff as if they were a part of your own community. You feel the pettiness and delusional gossip of the townspeople as if you were seeing it first hand. The story is riveting and the pace seems fast even when there is little action.The story starts with the protagonist (identified only by his initial, K.) walking to what sounds like a routine surveying job. Soon he is frustrated by a very confusing series of obstacles. As the story develops the obstacles become more chaotic. K.'s original purpose in going to the castle is never fully elaborated and his motives seem lost or stolen. The forces acting upon K. are shrouded. It seems as if some invisible force has plotted to test K. to the limit of human endurance of tolerance of ambiguity.Kafka combines the themes of:social class commentary,alienation from a heartless social system,absence of any protective power,salvation,redemption,fear of strangers,fear of change,search for the meaning of life,inscrutability of authorities,indifference of forces ruling human fate,persistence in the face lost purpose,abuse of powerandacceptance of pointlessness goals.As the plot progresses it takes on a surreal nightmare quality. Is the protagonist having a nightmare, going insane or confronting the reality of his situation?There is no end to the frustration. We are never told if K. is having a nightmare or going insane. We never discover why K. is so determined to enter the castle that he would tolerate and even join in to the absurdity. His original purpose of doing a surveying job could never justify his struggle to gain admittance. We are left seeing K. as a perpetual outsider. Perhaps Kafka is telling us that there is no end or limit to frustration, alienation and absurdity. Those seeking an answer to the ageless enigma of existence will never find a simple resolution.This is a disturbing work that challenges conventional notions of plot and character development while testing the readers conception of his/her purpose in life. The Castle will confront the reader in unexpected ways and raise emotional personal issues that would otherwise be repressed.See:The MetamorphosisThe TrialAmerikaCollections:The Diaries of Franz Kafka (Schocken Classics Series)Collected Stories (Everyman's Library)The Z&uuml;rau Aphorisms of Franz KafkaBlue Octavo NotebooksKafka's Selected Stories (Norton Critical Edition)Give It Up: And Other Short StoriesGreat German Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)I highly recommend this book.\"}"}]}

M. Kelley\", \"text\" : \"Wesley C. Mitchell (1874-1948) was one of America's preeminent economists. I studied his bookBusiness Cycles (Classic Reprint)(1913) as an undergraduate student in 1960. His book titled Types of Economic Theory is a classic in history of economic thought. At only $45.00 the two-volume book is a steal!Mitchell's passion was business cycles, and his persuasion was institutionalist economics. Former Federal Reserve Board chairman Arthur Burns was one of his students and co-authored their book titledMeasuring Business Cycles (National Bureau of Economic Research. Studies in business cycles)(1946) with Mitchell. Mitchell was a founder of the prestigious National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 1920, and was its director until 1945. One of his colleagues at NBER was Simon Kuznets, who was awarded the Nobel prize for developing the national income and product accounts (NIPA) social accounting system used by all countries today.This book, Types of Economic Theory, is a compilation in two volumes of student notes that were initially mimeographed by a student, John Meyers in 1926-192, and later edited with other of Mitchell's papers as these volumes in 1475 pages with an index by Joseph Dorfman. Interestingly the publisher, Augustus M. Kelley, was also a student of Mitchell.Mitchell's thesis in his book is that there are different types of economic theories for two reasons:Firstly different economists addressed different problems that were prominent in their day. This reason occasioned his erudite research in economic history, principally the economic histories of Great Britain and the United States. He rejected the heroic theory of invention, and subscribed to the social theory of invention (Vol. I, P. 6) One of his memorable refrains is \"The social process which constitutes the development of the social sciences is a process of incessant interaction between logically arranged ideas and chronologically arranged events.\" (Vol. I, P. 27)Secondly different economists had different ideas of human nature from Adam Smith's natural-law view to Thorstein Veblen's anthropological-institutionalist view. Due to lack of economic data most economists created one or another ersatz psychology for their economic analyses. Mitchell prognosticated in 1924 that as data becomes more available, economics will become a quantitative science that will be less concerned with puzzles about economic motives and more concerned about the objective validity of the account that it gives of economic processes.In an article titled \"Quantitative Analysis in Economic Theory\" in American Economic Review (1925) Mitchell predicted that quantitative and statistical analyses in economics will result in a radical change in the content of economic theory from the prevailing type such as may be found in the works of the famous Cambrian economist Alfred Marshall. Mitchell said that instead of interpreting the data in terms of subjective motives, which are assumed as constituting an explanation and which are added to the data, quantitative economists may either just disregard motives, or more likely they may regard them as problems for investigation rather than assumed explanations and draw any conclusions about them from the data.Mitchell is therefore identified as an institutionalist economist. He had studied under Veblen, the founder of American institutionalist economics, at Chicago University. He also spent many years at Columbia University, where he was an associate of the pragmatist philosopher John Dewey. Mitchell's methodological views are much more consistent with the contemporary pragmatist philosophy of science preailing in academia today, than with the neoromanticism still prevailing in academic neoclassical economics.In his \"Prospects of Economics\" in Tugwell's bookThe Trend of Economics (Series on Economic Thought, History and Challenge) (2 volumes)(1924) he also said that economists will have a special predilection for the study of institutions, because institutions standardize behavior thus enabling generalizations and facilitating statistical procedure.In class notes dated October 1931 Mitchell said that the chief aim of his course is constructive, to help young economists to decide how they can make their most effective contribution toward the development of economic theory by working through the various types to a unified position. Such unity has since been accomplished after the appearance of Keynes General Theory. But the unity is not the institutionalist approach Mitchell had expected; it is the neoclassical economics with its psychology of \"rationality postulates.\" An attempt to relate neoclassical theory to econometric modeling was published by Trygve Haavelmo in 1944. But the result has been to relegate econometrics to testing of a priori theory rather than to discovery.But econometric models based on theory have demonstrated limited forecasting accuracy, thus giving rise to a more pragmatic and empirical approach based on data analysis, which is strongly suggestive of Mitchell's preference to draw conclusions from the data. I think that Mitchell will have the last word in economics as an empirical science. In the \"Conclusion\" at the end of the second volume he says:\"It seems quite obvious that a much more scientific way of trying to give a satisfactory account of human behavior is to give up the assumption contrary to fact, that it is all planned out, and to approach the problem in an objective spirit, to observe the economic behavior of men both widely and closely, and to try to discover, as a result of observations, what generalizations can be made; whether there are uniformities in behavior; what these uniformities are.\" Pp. 787-8.See myHistory of Twentieth-Century Philosophy of Science(BOOK VIII) at my web site, philsci, and my ebookPhilosophy of Science: An Introduction.Thomas J.

Every 18 months, more people die from HIV / AIDS than during the Holocaust. In some parts of Africa, they literally are running out of land to bury the bodies.Ms. Hunter, with her years of experience working with the UN on Africa, is in a unique position to offer an assessment of the effects of this disease on that continent as well as predictions of its spread globally.In the United States, many have become complacent about HIV / AIDS, believing that this is a disease which can be controlled with a few pills -- and as a result, HIV / AIDS infection is on the rise in the U.S. once again. Ms. Hunter's descriptions bring the realities of HIV / AIDS back into sharp, painful focus.

Your mileage may vary.Califia also takes a realistic attitude about doing SM throughout the book, pointing out for example that what may really hot in your mind (like a full on 24/7 D/s relationship) may not be practical when it comes to things like doing shopping or picking up the dry cleaning, or holding down a 9 to 5 job every day. Or that your Top may have a bad day or not be perfect at all times. Reality rears its ugly head.Califia even includes a glossary of terms in the back, a resource guide, and further reading material. While the book is aimed primarily toward people new to BDSM, there's enough material here that even so-called &quot;veteran&quot; SM players will enjoy reading. Califia is a long time community member and his experience shows in the writing of this book.\"}"}]}

On the first the protagonist seems to be an average person: He does not have a focus in his life, is unstable and feels unloved. That is very interesting about the book because this ordinary person from the beginning becomes someone special in the end.The protagonist, Jonah, is a journalist who wants to write a novel about the \"father of the atomic bomb\" whose family he meets doing research. Jonah finds out about Ice-nine, a substance that converts water into ice even at high temperatures, it is unclear if this substance is existent or not. This stays mysterious until the ending of the book, which is an apocalypse, all life on earth dies of Ice-nine. The author has a very descriptive style. The story takes place in unpleasant settings. The characters in \"Cat's Cradle\" are weird, persons who are very rare in real life because they are so extreme. The plot itself is unrealistic. Vonnegut has a black and white view of life: something is good and bad. There is nothing that is just good or bad. The result of the book is that also science is bad sometimes because it can be destructive and even religion is not only good because it is based on lies.The book is entertaining and it has an unique humor which is not to be understood for everybody. Who does not like black humor would probably not think the book is funny. But the novel is still a good book to read because it makes people, who are interested in its theme, think about it and get interesting points of view. For people who just want a book for pure entertainment it is not the right book to read.\"}"}]}

As one of the last Warner Bros. contract players, she appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers on a Train. Seen at her best in strong parts, such as the ambitious Ronda Castle in Anthony Mann's The Far Country or as a modern-day Lady Macbeth, she enjoyed a varied career as a freelancer before re-inventing herself as a character actress of note on television. A remarkable return to the screen in the bizarre psycho-horror The Baby (1973) assured her of cult status.

Academy Award's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (12/2/51) gives us Ray Milland and Frank Lovejoy in the roles created by Farley Granger and Robert Walker. All of these are extremely well done, forced (of course) by time considerations to leave out certain events shown in the film (such as the actual murder of the wife by psychopath Bruno in &quot;Strangers&quot;).The half-hour shows are not nearly as satisfying, being forced to rush the plots almost to the point of mere outlines of the originals.

Tolkien, beloved author of THE HOBBIT. In SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR, Tolkien explores the gift of fantasy, and what it means to the life and character of the man who receives it. And FARMER GILES OF HAM tells a delightfully ribald mock-heroic tale, where a dragon who invades a town refuses to fight, and a farmer is chosen to slay him.\", \"authors\": \"['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien']\", \"publisher\" : \"Del Rey\", \"text\" : \"Smith of Wootton Major, written between 1964 and 1966* and published in 1967, is a meditation on the gift of fantasy. It originally was to be a very short story to be included to a preface of George MacDonald's famous faerie story The Golden Key. The story soon began a life of its own, and though altogether brief gives an insightful view into Tolkien's life.The story is about Smith, who is a normal boy of all accounts. In his village are great feasts, and the Feast of Twenty Four is held. A star, little more than thought a Trinket by the Master Cook, is placed within tie cake, and he eats it unknowing. Then beauty comes upon him, and after he grows up begins to wonder in Faery. This is much the life of Tolkien. Born in South Africa in 1892, he was a little British boy that came to live in England. He became immersed in two things: mythology and language. Soon, so in love with language, he began inventing his own. In the end, he wished to have people speak his languages, to have a history behind it: thus arose Middle-earth. Then, as time went on, just as Smith, Tolkien explored the fantastic worlds, and was accustomed to strange lands.In the story it is stated he spoke little of it to anyone OUTSIDE of his family. This is also true of Tolkien. Although his (deeply loved) wife was not real involved in his writing, he shared his stories with his family, and it is not to far to say that had it not been for his four children The Lord of the Rings would never have been written. (To understand this statement, one must first realise who The Hobbit was written for. It was written for his children. This, along with Farmer Giles, Roverandom (newly published), the Father Christmas Letters, and Mr. Bliss, his children's picture book personally illustarted by him. Unwin, his publisher wanted a sequel to The Hobbit, so he began The Lord of the Rings, a much less serious work in the beginning than at last evolved too. So without these we would not have gotten his adult masterpiece).Then old age approached. Although his mind was not dimmed, time had worked its decay on his body, and much of his strength was sapped. He realised that he was a mortal, and even though he had had a passport to Faery, it did not grant him eternal physical life. Tolkien was sad about this, and wished to finish The Silmarillion. But life is life, and Tolkien knew his life was drawing to an end. Just like his beautiful little people who also knew morality, the hobbits, he died in 1973, 2 September, just shy of dying ten years after his friend C. S. Lewis (who died the same day as Auldous Huxley and JFK). Tolkien, just as Frodo and Bilbo, went on the great ships into Paradise, Heaven. He took sick with a gastric ulcer, and developed a chest infection, dying.Tolkien was of melancholy temperament, and they are notorious for being prone to depression. Tolkien was of the great artistic class, and he knew depression well. It was depression that this story was borne of. In the very last letter in LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, he tells his daughter as something of a P. S. \"It is stuffy, sticky, and rainy at present - but forecasts are more. favourable\". As far as my knowledge goes, that is the last thing he wrote, being four days before his death. There is much hope in that statement, even though Tolkien had no way of knowing how much relevance that to that moment in his life.This is the closest thing of autobiography he has written. This, along with his marvelous short story Leaf by Niggle, are essential of you want to read and understand this Godly man's life. Tree and Leaf, a small book containing the short story aforementioned and his classic essay On Faerie Stories, along with this, will enlighten you greatly on his views of Faerie. These three are essential to understand this man. Leaf By Niggle is him venting his frustration, and then him expressing great hope for his work. It also reflects his Catholicism, as Niggle goes thru purgatory.*This is deduced from LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN. In letter 262, Tolkien accepts the invitation to write a preface to The Golden Key, the short story by MacDonald. It was here, in that abandoned preface, that he began Smith, of what was to be a very short story. It had a life of its own, and grew to present length. In letter 270, dated 20 May 1965, Tolkien is talking to Rayner Unwin, his publisher (and as a child reviewed THE HOBBIT for publication, who received, if my memory serves me correctly, ten shillings for reading and writing a little report over it for his father Stanley.) The typescript of this story had been submitted for publication..-----------Notes on the Extended Edition, edited by Verlyn FliegerThe extended edition (which is the definitive version), features a good deal of extra material.There is brief one page forward by Flieger, where Flieger in accordance to Tolkien's clear wishes as demonstrated in the abandoned Golden Key preface states \"Reader, meet SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR\".It includes an Afterword by Tolklien scholar Verlyn Fledger where she examines the SMITH in relation to Tolkien's other short fiction (ROVERANDOM, MR. BLISS, FARMER GILES OF HAM, and LEAF BY NIGGLE).This is the newly published material by Tolkien himself exclusive to the extended edition\"Genesis of the Story\". A note to Clyde S. Kilby (author of the criminally underated minimalist book TOLKIEN AND THE SILMARILION) where Tolkien discus his dislike of George MacDonald and how SMITH is his answer to THE GOLDEN KEY and serves as an anti-George MacDonald tract.\"Tolkien's Draft Introduction to The Golden Key\": by far one of the most interesting segments in the entire book, as SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR famously began life as a preface to MacDonald's fairy tale THE GOLDEN KEY but was never completed. Tolkien examines fairy tales and then begins a short story in the preface itself, where the work breaks off, forever incomplete and unfinished (as a preface anyway).\"The Great Cake Time Scheme and Characters\": originally hte work began as \"The Great Cake\" and this is just a brief inventory of characters. The characters sheet is about a page and a half. Tolkien, being Tolkien, then gives a chronology by year (think the Tale of Years in LOTR) of the events in the story.The fourth item is \"Suggestions for the ending of the story\" where he debates on how to end his new fiction.\"Smith of Wootton Major\" is easily the most important piece in the book with the exception of the main work itself. This piece (whose title does not distinguish itself from the main story) is an essay Tolkien wrote about what he meant (and did not mean) by the work and how this relates to his ideas of Faery.The next piece is \"[Hybrid draft and transcription of `The Great Cake']\" which is a manuscript/typescript hybrid of the original draft of the story. This has a facsimile of Tolkien's manuscript and type script on the left side and the printed text [transcript] on the right side.The last piece is \"Lake of Tears drafts and transcriptions\" which are draft sections of SMITH...-----This review was written April 12, 2000, just a few months shy of twelve years ago. (That does not include the notes and information about the extra content in the extended edition, which was written December 14, 2011). I left the review unreleased as it started out as a joint review of the FARMER GILES/SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR combo volume but soon became solely focused on SMITH. I did release this on the Amazon.co.uk site back in 2001, as it hasn't lived a permanently isolated life on my hard drive like some of my other unreleased/unfinished Amazon reviews have done, living a cloistered existence.\"}"}]}

In New York Times bestselling author Anne Perry's newest novel featuring Victorian-era sleuth Thomas Pitt, London is a city besieged by anarchists. After a violent gun battle between rioters and police, a chase culminates in narrow, cobbled Long Spoon Lane, where Magnus Landsborough, the young son of Lord Sheridan Landsborough, is shot to death. Two anarchists are arrested, and they provide conflicting evidence about Landsborough's death: was he the victim of an accident or murder, and was he a hostage of the anarchists or an anarchist himself? Anne Perry lives in Scotland Anne Perry is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including Southampton Row and Seven Dials, and the William Monk novels, most recently Death of a Stranger and The Shifting Tide. Most of Perry's novels are set in the Victorian era, though she has also written books set in the early 20th century, edited anthologies, and even has a fantasy title in her bibliography\", \"authors\": \"['Anne Perry']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"Special Branch Investigator Thomas Pitt must find out who killed Magnus Landsborough, a young anarchist whose group has just bombed a house in an ordinary working class London neighborhood. It's apparent to Pitt from the start that someone within the group committed the murder, an idea that the two anarchists he arrests find shocking. Pitt soon discovers that the anarchists' target was the home of a corrupt police sergeant, which infuriates the former police inspector and even more enrages his friend and former subordinate, Bow Street's Sergeant Tellman, who continues courting the Pitts' maid, Gracie. The last person on earth Pitt would choose to work with is Sir Charles Voisey, a man who not long ago tried to hire the murders of Pitt's family - wife Charlotte, their two children, and Gracie. But for this investigation, he needs Voisey and Voisey needs him. How far can he trust the man, though? That is the question on which Pitt's safety rests....I have to admit that I enjoy the earlier Pitt novels more than the later ones, as far as the cases are concerned. I prefer the more straightforward plots, \"whodunnits\" of sorts, to these more recent books built around conspiracies. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Tellman as a major character; and Gracie is always a treat. Perry's gift for portraying the various levels of Victorian society really shines in this novel. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.--Reviewed by Nina M.

When I picked up Playing Up With Pompey I thought it was going to be just another 'we went to this match had a fight, dranks fifty pints of beer, smashed up a pub, had another fight, and went home' I was delighted to find out however that this was not the case. Yes the book is about the Portsmouth 6.57 Crew a gang of football hooligans, and yes many of their fights are of course featured, because there wouldn't be a lot of point to the book other wise would there? What makes this book so different is the way it is written, Beech has a very witty writing style and adds a lot of humour to the tales. Also unlike many books of this type he does not try to portray the 6.57 Crew as the toughest meanest gang on the plant, and unlike other titles is open and honest enough to say when they came off second best. Reading the book took me onto the terraces with them, I have never been involved in this type of thing, it also gave me a kind of understanding of what made people like Beech tick, the comradeship of being on enemy turf waiting for the battle cry to go up. If you have already dipped your toe into the world football violence books, then dive straight into the deep end with this one you won't be dissapointed.\"}"}]}

Ents are walking, talking trees found in Fanghorn Forest. Treebeard (a most &quot;unhasty&quot; Ent) is their leader. He's the oldest living thing in Middle Earth.

This was a time when half of all the warships in the world were Royal Navy ships. In this book, Rif Winfield has gone at least one step further than most authors by including all there is to know about every single Royal Navy warship between 1793 and 1817. By \"all there is to know,\" he includes everything from cradle to grave which, as the book's full title suggests, includes their individual design, construction, career and eventual fate. Whilst research is the key to such an undertaking, that is still a very tall order. Nevertheless, Mr Winfield has succeeded most admirably and I congratulate him on a very professional job well done.Whilst I am always reluctant to use the phrase \"Definitive work,\" such sentiments accurately describe this excellent book which is well laid out and easy to follow - and that means it is easy to find what you may be looking for.Commencing with a chronology of the naval engagements of 1792-1817 followed by the fleet actions of the same period, the author skilfully sets the scene by giving the reader a brief insight into what is to be expected from his book. We are then taken on an historic tour of this period of British Naval history commencing with chapters on; First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Rate ships, Ship Sloops, Brig Sloops, Gunboats and Gunbrigs, Cutters and Schooners, Miscellaneous warships, Miscellaneous Auxiliaries and finally a complete Index.As we go through each section of each chapter, I am reminded of other well-known tomes famous for their details of ship-types, but this is much better because the author has made \"his\" reference work into an interesting read.Ordinarily, of course, one would expect to find errors somewhere. Bearing in mind this is a large format book over 3 cm thick and containing over 400 pages, I am not going to claim to have read every single word (not yet anyway). I have, however, carefully studied those areas of the book which are well known to me making comparisons with a number of other reputable sources. I have discovered no errors or omissions. Altogether, therefore, this is a most complete and competent work.This may be an expensive book, but it contains far more information than other comparable works on the same subject I have yet to encounter. In short, this is great value for money and should become an invaluable reference source for those with an interest. Probably, one of those books you will wish you had purchased - after it ceases publication.NM\"}"}]}

The first story in the book, \u2018Jeeves Takes Charge\u2019, describes Jeeves' arrival in his master's life, as a replacement for Wooster's previous, thieving valet, and features Lady Florence Craye, as well as a passing mention of Lord Emsworth and Blandings Castle. Bertie Wooster\u2019s life is in disarray. He has just fired his personal valet for stealing and his fianc\u00e9e Florence wants Bertie to destroy his uncle\u2019s memoirs. And then everything changes. He hires Jeeves as his valet and Jeeves takes charge. His taste is impeccable, his judgment infallible. Bertie and his friends quickly become reliant on the inimitable Reginald Jeeves. Several of the other stories are set in New York, and the book includes appearances by regular characters Bingo Little, Aunt Dahlia, Anatole, and Sir Roderick Glossop. Wonderfully written, full of wit and humor, eccentric characters, and incisive comedians.\", \"authors\": \"['P.G. Wodehouse', 'General Press']\", \"publisher\" : \"GENERAL PRESS\", \"text\" : \"I'm not embarrassed to say that I came to the Jeeves stories many years ago through the wonderful BBC television program starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. For some reason, it took me a few decades to actually pick-up a Wodehouse book, though this one has been sitting on my shelf for a long while. It's too bad, really, because excellent writers of humor are so rare, and Wodehouse definitely fits into the category of excellent writers of humor.Consider this turn of phrase (from \"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\"): \"She fitted into my biggest arm-chair as if it had been built round her by someone who knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season.\" I laughed aloud when I read this. It's an image both telling in the story and unforgettable as I think back on it. Wodehouse is a master of such humorous images. And the idiosyncratic dialect spoken by Bertie as our guide through most of these tales, is a linguistic masterpiece.Of course, the real charm of these stories comes from the characters. Every story is populated by a new set of colorful supporting cast of rich aunts & uncles, grasping nephews, clueless beaus and brides-to-be. But the great constant is the semi-dynamic duo, Bertie Wooster and his manservant, Jeeves. Bertie and his friends manage to get in scrape after scrape, but Jeeves always manages to come to the rescue (once his pique over matters of sartorial taste are mollified) with his extensive knowledge of his \"betters\" and their quirks of behavior.Of the number of collections of Jeeves stories and novels, this one has much to recommend it. So many of the stories are first-rate. \"Jeeves Takes Charge\" relates the first encounter between Wooster and Jeeves. A number of stories take place in New York City, where Bertie gets exiled after irritating his aunt--a treat for American fans. \"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\" stars what is certainly Bertie's most air-headed pal (and that's saying a lot), and one of my favorite endings in the Palace of Beauty at the Wembly exhibition.In fact, the only sour note for me is the last story in the collection, \"Bertie Changes his Mind\". Not that the story doesn't have its humorous moments, but it was disconcerting to me to have Jeeves narrate the story instead of Bertie. Jeeves works best for me as that enigma hovering at the edge of the stage, only walking in when needed to solve the problems. Seeing him continuously in action too much of a peek behind the curtain for me.Still, these are fun, fun stories. A bit repetitive, sure, but fun just the same. Anyone who enjoys period stories that poke a bit of fun at the rich and BYTs of the post-(WWI)war period will find a lot to like here.\"}"}]}

Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist.

Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt\u2019s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong \u2014 and strongly reasoned \u2014 anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.\", \"authors\": \"['Henry Hazlitt']\", \"publisher\" : \"Currency\", \"text\" : \"Let me start by saying this book is excellent.

This is an incredible feat of writing. Mr. Wong communicates his feelings in words to totally move me. There I was on a plane reading the book, one minute crying, next laughing out loud. Those around me, each in their own time, all inquired as to the nature of the book, having watched me for several hours. Mr. Wong captivates the emotions of the reader through his moments of happiness and grieve, laughter and pain, all within the snap of a finger. Sure the book is a tribute to parenthood and Gay life, but it is far more than that. Through words he captures the dream of life. I really felt as though I was living through parts of the story! I was so moved by the book and the atmosphere that Mr. Wong creates that I can only but jump up and down with joy and gratitude that he choose to share with the world this story. He really opens his heart and mind to the world through this book. I wait with baited breath for the next written work by the author (although I would be most thankful if it were not such a difficult true story for the author to write about). Mr. Wong may have long been a noted as an accomplished and acclaimed actor. Through his book he certainly has earned the title of author extraordinary. It is rare indeed for an author's first book to be so excellent. Finally, much of the book is a compilation of e-mails written by the author to his loved one as updates during the events of his life. Much to my surprise the web site is actually real and a most delightful accent to the book. Buy it, read it, laugh and cry through and with it. You will not be disappointed. I would not be surprised if someday it is required reading for college courses. What an awesome experience that would be for students!\"}"}]}

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language.

With Lane's consent, Weaver retold her story in his own way, making use of her ideas but adding material from his personal experience and other relevant sources.Part One: Comparisons and Contrasts, explores various puzzling questions of history in the context of the concept of human energy. In this sphere three crucial factors are identified: the nature of human energy, the recognition of the human race as one & the quest for the ideal method for individuals to combine their energies.Part Two: Old World Views, contrasts the fatalistic pagan outlook on life with the Judeo-Christian view of individual freedom and personal responsibility. The pagan view of life was static, time was seen as cyclical and authority was absolute; the Bible speaks of time as linear and even the King of Israel was subject to the law. Thepantheonsof the Sumerian, Semitic & Indo-European peoples consisted of capricious & indifferent deities whereas Scripture reveals a compassionate Father.Part Three: The Revolution, looks at mankind's attempts to attain individual freedom: the ancient Israelites, the golden age of Islamic civilization, Britain and the American Revolution. The era of the Judges was libertarian, for a while the Islamic world carried the torch of liberty, the British adhered to a principle of freedom granted (Magna Carta) within circumscribed social classes whilst the American Revolution finally recognized the individual as inherently free.Part Four: The Fruits Of Freedom, investigates the results of the acceptance of personal liberty, including the flowering of inventive genius that followed. It also explores, in the light of history, concepts of hope versus fear, freedom of choice, the dynamic versus the static, themoralversus the material, control versus creativity & voluntary co-operation that proved to be a dynamo of prosperity.The writing style is accessible and absorbing; interesting quotes by people likeThomas Paine, Fredric Bastiat andIsabel Patersonenhance the text. In a thought-provoking way, the book explains many problems still plaguing the world today, tracing them back to the ancient conflict between pagan fatalism and the principles of the Hebrew tradition.Of course there arenon-religious philosophies of freedombased on reason alone, and the aforementioned Paine was a theist who was opposed to dogmatic religion. But whether one agrees with all of Weaver's points or not, The Mainspring Of Human Progress is a classic that remains an eloquent defense of individual liberty. The book concludes with a list of references, a bibliography and an index.On the subject of individual freedom, I also recommend the work of Ludwig von Mises, Alfred North Whitehead, Stefan Hoeller, Robert Nozick'sAnarchy, State, And Utopia, Milton Friedman andJohan Norberg.The Road to Serfdomby Friedrich Hayek and the work of Ayn Rand are highly relevant for our time.\"}"}]}

From Stockholm to Hawaii to the mountain vastness of Peru, from disbelief to radiant affirmation, she at last discovers the roots of her very existence. . . and the infinite possibilities of life.

This easy to read and highly entertaining 380 page book is a veritable everything you ever wanted to know about the New Age compendium that brought the concept of channeling and reincarnation into mainstream consciousness in unprecedented fashion.Shirley's revolutionary book came along when the time was ripe for an alternative approach to the divine. A large portion of the population had given up on the Sunday go to church ritual to hear about how the experience of God had touched the lives of people in the remote past. They hungered for something more recent, more accessible and most of all more experiential. Ms. MacLaine provided just that, a contemporary spiritual quest encompassing a myriad of belief systems and personal encounters with living, illumined teachers dispensing wisdom. All this blended with numerous, always eerie and invigorating synchronistic occurrences (meaningful coincidence) that so enthrall us made `Out on a Limb' a sure hit with the public-at-large.Unthinkable as it may seem, her simplistic, nave understanding of spirituality has now become the norm for many, especially within the Hollywood elite and has caused a paradigm shift in modern day society that is still evolving. I'm not sure whether the positive brought about by this new mindset outweighs the negative backwash of spurious information and shallow thinking brought about by this book, but it is change nonetheless.Whether you agree with Shirley or not is not the point. She stands alone as an agent of change, new age guru, spiritual guide, cultural phenomenon and a sociological event that cannot be denied no matter how many people sit back and laugh at her beliefs. Many years from now long after you and I are gone this book will still be read and recognized as an important milestone in the history of the `New Age' movement.

This particular edition rounds out at about 200 pages, and it was a quick read for me. It's not terribly fast-paced by today's standards, but it is engaging. The title character, Victor Frankenstein, grows up with an affinity for science and is determined to make his mark on humanity. He scavenges for human body parts until he is able to create, and bring to life, a new creation. As soon his creation comes to life, however, Victor is horrified by what he refers to as \"the monster.\"The novel is a frame story, and Victor's tale is conveyed by a ship's captain who finds him wandering in the North. The story of the monster is told mostly from Victor Frankenstein's point of view, but in some longer parts the monster narrates his experiences to Victor. For me, the monster's story was the most riveting part of the novel--I found Victor's character a bit annoying at times. The novel as a whole emphasizes the potential dangers of science, but it also brings to light themes of the dire consequences when the \"created\" is neglected or, worse, treated ill. The monster's character starts out as quite a sympathetic one, until he meets with the horror and revulsion of human beings he encounters. This raises issues about the consequences of intolerance that are relevant today; the enduring themes of the novel help to make it a classic.While those who prefer a fast-paced plot may be a bit bored with this, fans of earlier Gothic literature will enjoy the ride. This edition has useful end notes as well as a helpful scholarly introduction (best read after the novel is finished due to spoilers) and biographical information about the author.

This collection of essays and interviews examines how playful fandom--from fanfiction to Muggle quidditch, cosplay, role-playing games, and even Harry Potter burlesque--not only reimagines the canon but also challenges consumerism, questions notions of identity, and fosters participatory culture. The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.\", \"authors\": \"['Lisa S.

The ending its self is a great example of profound writing skills.

First, the impeccable UBS text--4th edition! For the serious student, the straight text itself is probably worth the price Amazon charges for the entire toolbox.Second, a great literal interlinear text. I never study the Greek New Testament without the lexicon close at hand; but this interlinear is great as a prompt for the casual contribution in group Bible study or Sunday School. Some people will say it is wooden, but it is not meant to be a substitute for a translation; it is not meant to flow but to prompt the reader as to the significance of the word.Third--and the main reason I purchased this book--is the terrific Greek concordance. The numbers are Strong's, which is great for anyone using other similarly keyed study tools; but every single word in the text is keyed, and every single text--every usage of the given word--is listed. Verbs and nouns are listed in their lexical forms. If you want to make a comparison of the uses (for example) of AGAPAO and PHILEO, it is all at your fingertips.The fourth great tool--almost like a bonus thrown in for being one of the first ten callers--is the parallel NRSV text, in detail with its footnotes. The NRSV is my personal choice for both study and devotional reading. Its textual soundness is virtually without parallel. It is just the thing to complement this great package--kind of like the handle that fits all of the other tools.I don't know how this work had esceaped my attention in the past; I will not be without it again.One more thing: I had priced the hard copy edition at a bookstore chain, and seeing Amazon's price I expected it to be paper--it wasn't!\"}"}]}

Upon her father's ascension to the illustrious throne of England, Elizabeth Stuart was suddenly thrust from the poverty of unruly Scotland into the fairy-tale existence of a princess of great wealth and splendor. When she was married at sixteen to a German count far below her rank, it was with the understanding that her father would help her husband achieve the kingship of Bohemia. The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin \"the Winter Queen,\" as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost. But it was the youngest, Sophia, a heroine in the tradition of a Jane Austen novel, whose ready wit and good-natured common sense masked immense strength of character, who fulfilled the promise of her great-grandmother Mary and reshaped the British monarchy, a legacy that endures to this day. Brilliantly researched and captivatingly written, filled with danger, treachery, and adventure but also love, courage, and humor, Daughters of the Winter Queen follows the lives of five remarkable women who, by refusing to surrender to adversity, changed the course of history.\", \"authors\": \"['Nancy Goldstone']\", \"publisher\" : \"Little, Brown\", \"text\" : \"I read this book in Russian (I read all of Akunin's book about Fandorin).

D. Salinger to American readers in the years after World War II, including \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" and the first appearance of Salinger's fictional Glass family. Nine exceptional stories from one of the great literary voices of the twentieth century. Witty, urbane, and frequently affecting, Nine Stories sits alongside Salinger's very best work--a treasure that will passed down for many generations to come. The stories: A Perfect Day for Bananafish Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut Just Before the War with the Eskimos The Laughing Man Down at the Dinghy For Esm\u00e9--with Love and Squalor Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period Teddy\", \"authors\": \"['J.D. Salinger']\", \"publisher\" : \"Little, Brown\", \"text\" : \"Children are dominant images, and there is a sense of sympathy and honest respect for their ability to see, easily and honestly, that logic and reasoning and the defining of boundaries are the reason for suffering. That is the essence of Teddy. Salinger writes brilliant children brilliantly, and in these stories, he can be much more brazen with the actions and words of characters than in a novel. I would like to read Catcher in The Rye, as I know, from rumour that it also involves a love of children. I'm also curious about that new book his daughter wrote. But its not just about children, meaning young humans. For Eloise, the death of her first love (incidentally Buddy Glass's brother Walter, I believe), makes her &quot;grow up&quot; into a life of curtained misery. Her daughter's prescense and relation to the imaginary friend is a device that JDS uses to show how Eloise has inevitably and miserably matured. The child Lionel, in &quot;Down at the Dinghy,&quot; is also written well, though this story seems simpler. The narrator of deDaumier-Smith's Blue Period realizes how he is seen, he is a somewhat frightening man. He is no longer a boy, though he lies and acts like one and longs for his dead mother. Death's appearance in these stories is important and related to the children notions, and they're brought together in Teddy. But basically, the end of childhood, whether we're talking pure bachelorhood (Laughing Man), the naivete of an affair, the realization of circumstances, brings a longing for death. Logical knowledge, as we know it, is a trap, and when characters see the design of the trap, (and readers too), a quite divine sadness can come about. Salinger, in Franny and Zooey, this book, and Seymour and others, often talks of the Vedanta tradition, and of Ramakrishna. Vedanta, which allows for one truth, which men call by different names, lets people explore religions fully. If you learn about it, you can much more fully understand and appreciate Salinger's religion in his books. Only Teddy mentions it in his book. But you can read about Ramakrishna in &quot;The Gospel of SriRamakrishna&quot; translated by Swami Nikhilananda, a dense and specific book about one man, but a major influence on JDS.Furthermore, my favorite stories in this volume are Bananafish, The Laughing Man, For Esme with Love and Squalour, Teddy. Pretty Mouth and Green Eyes is the weakest, but it's not bad. Salinger does show he's up to the task to write modern short stories.\"}"}]}

As with four of the other five, it follows the same formula of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \"Emma\" where the protagonist has her owns means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work.\"Pride and Prejudice\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\" or Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina.\" From a strictly literary point of view, \"Mansfield Park\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \"Persuasion\" among her novels? The present novel is good and it is generally thought of as one of her five best. It is one of her mature novels - as opposed to Northanger Abbey, an early work. It has a good story and good characters. I liked her treatment of Captain Wentworth. The description and the story about the primary character, Anne Elliot, is vintage Austen writing and story telling. But overall it does not quite reach the heights of those other two great Austen novels. Still, I rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It is more a question of whether you like the story or not, since it follows the Austen formula. All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humor and irony.Austen wrote the novel based on contemporay life in England from approximately 1814 to 1815, in the post Napolean period, and it was published in 1816 after her other works. Overall I would rate it as excellent but not her best. It is similar to \"Sense and Sensibility\"and much better than her early novel \"Northanger Abbey\" in terms of literary sophistication and the characters, and it ranks behind the two novels mentioned above and \"Emma.\" Those three (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park) are her finest works.Most Austen fans will love the book, and I would recommend the novel.\"}"}]}

It is an epic novel; the story of the Don Cossacks and the impact upon them of some of the most tumultuous events of the 20th Century: the First World War, the Communist revolution in Russia which ended that country's participation in the war, and the ensuing civil war thereafter, between the \"Reds\" (the revolutionary forces) and the \"Whites\" (the forces of the old, Czarist order.) The Cossacks were the legendary warriors who had mastered the tactics of the cavalry; and, at one time or another had struck fear into most European armies. (They were also \"the enforcers,\" who were often called upon to help quell internal dissent in Czarist Russia). Only once in the book did Sholokhov hint of their origins: they were serfs who had fled their \"masters.\" And they settled along the Don River, one of the great ones of Russia, and with the Volga River, flows into the Black Sea. One of the most extraordinary aspects of this novel is that Sholokhov wrote it less than a decade after these cataclysmic events; that Stalin was in power, definitely an \"enforcer\" in is own right, with strong views of how the past should be represented; and that Sholokhov is relating the story of those who, in very large measure, fought on the side of the losing \"Whites\" in the Civil War (although, for sure, as the book depicts, there were numerous exceptions.)The book starts on the Melekhov farm in the village of Tatarsk, on the Don River. During the last war with Turkey, Melekhov brought back a Turkish \"wife\" who genes would be passed into the family line, and there are repeated references to the family's Turkish features throughout the book. The first third of the book describes village life during two years of peace, from 1912 to 1914. If there is a principal character in the book it is Gregor Melekhov. The loves and hates of the village are described, including his adulterous affair with his neighbor's wife, Aksinia, and his ill-stared marriage to Natalia Korshunova. Woven into this section are insights into the economic structure of village life. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the author's evocative depictions of the natural world, which recalls the nature writing of Joseph Wood KrutchThe Best Nature Writing of Joseph Wood Krutch. Sholokhov only foreshadows \"the Gathering Storm\" of World War I on a couple of occasions, and uses the character of Osip Stockman, a dedicated Bolshevik, to foreshadow the coming Communist revolution. I believe this portion of the book is the strongest, and most coherent, and could be a stand-alone book.War does come, and Sholokhov's depiction of it, mainly of the small unit fighting involving the Cossacks, rivalsErich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations). As one other reviewer noted, there are some powerful passages, such as: \"He had no cap, nor had he the upper part of his cranium, for it had been cut clean away by a shard of shrapnel. In the empty brain-pan, framed by damp strains of hair, glimmered rose-coloured rain-water.\" The larger picture of war is omitted, and although a large portion of this section is devoted to the beginning of the war, the disastrous (for the Russians) Battle of Tannenberg is omitted. This battle is depicted in excruciating detail in Solzhenitsyn'sAugust 1914For many Americans, the classic movie and book about this period isDr Zhivago / Movie [VHS] In the next section, the one of the Revolution, there is a scene that must have inspired one of the more powerful scenes from the movie. This is when the Russian armies are disintegrating, and there is a tense confrontation between the men who want to go home, and the officers who want them to keep fighting the Germans. Sholokhov has the officer standing on a wooden barrel, lecturing the troops, and it was the decisive action of only one soldier which turned the tide in favor of the revolution. Worse is to come, and Sholokhov describes it well: the Civil War, the \"brother against brother,\" as whole Cossack villages were literally torn apart.I agree with many of the 4-star reviewers in that there were perhaps too many characters, and too many loose ends. But, for me, that is the essence of the epic novel, as well as real life: the bit parts, the major actions, and life goes on, without any neat summation or redeeming purpose. It was a wonderful re-read, after 43 years, and still merits my original verdict of 5-stars.\"}"}]}

Another thing I know about Edgar Allan Poe is that even though there is some mystery about his true death as a result of his alcoholism, Poe died as tragically as one of his tortured characters. There are many known theories about it. I personally think he was not overall completely understood, and these stories/poems can tell how interesting his dark imagination was. He was emotionally torn apart by his wife's death in 1847. One cool thing about this book is that all of his stories take place at night. I got this great book for a bargain deal, and I don't find it strange at all that Edgar Allan Poe was obviously just as \"mad\" as a character in one of his stories because they represent what he feels and what he is thinking about a particularly creepy situation.

Grant"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"description\": \"In his eighth and final annual message to Congress, Ulysses S. Grant reminded the nation that it was his \"fortune or misfortune, to be called to the office of Chief Executive without any previous political training.\" The electoral crisis that dominated Grant's last months in office left little room for political error. On November 7, 1876, Democrat Samuel J. Tilden won the popular vote, but Republican Rutherford B. Hayes could claim the presidency by a single electoral vote if he captured all disputed electors from Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon. Uncertainty gave way to deadlock as the crisis deepened. Grant's mail included a steady trickle of anonymous threats. In late January 1877, Grant signed a bill creating an electoral commission to end the dispute. Hayes won all disputed electors and succeeded Grant without incident. Out of the White House, without a settled home, the Grants spent two months visiting family and friends before embarking on their long-planned European tour. On May 17, Grant left Philadelphia aboard the steamer Indiana. When he arrived at Liverpool, crowds thronged the docks and streets to give him a hero's welcome, and Londoners welcomed Grant with similar enthusiasm. In July, the Grants crossed to Belgium, traveled through Germany, and summered in the Swiss Alps and the lakes of northern Italy. Back in Great Britain, they toured Scotland and northern England, then visited daughter Ellen Grant Sartoris at Warsash, the Sartoris country home near Southampton. Grant spent November in Paris, later writing \"no American would stay in Paris if he found himself the only one of his countrymen there.\" The Grants wintered in the Mediterranean, sailing down the Italian coast to Sicily, where they spent Christmas, then to Alexandria, and a long trip up the Nile. The party toured the Holy Land, visited Constantinople and Athens, and spent a month in Italy. After another month in Paris, the Grants were off to Holland, Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, Austria, and Switzerland, exploring the Alps again before returning to Paris in September, 1878, to ponder their next move. Abroad and out of office, Grant freely talked about the war and his presidency. Several interviews stirred controversy in America and stoked talk of a third term in 1880, despite Grant's own protestation: \"I never wanted to get out of a place as much as I did to get out of the Presidency.\" The Grants had seen Europe. Now they faced a choice between home and a journey to distant Asia.\", \"authors\": \"['Ulysses Simpson Grant']\", \"publisher\" : \"SIU Press\", \"text\" : \"The twenty-six (and counting!) volumes comprising all the known extant writings of Ulysses Grant are indeed a remarkable example of published primary source material. While every volume contains much material that is admittedly of trivial importance to even the most rabid Grant scholar, each book in this series also contains fascinating nuggets of information not found anywhere else. Anyone with even a casual interest in USG is sure to discover something worth reading in every volume. In gathering together not only all of Grant's known correspondence, but relevant peripheral documents, the editors of this series are doing a truly Herculean job and deserve great commendation.I have only a few quibbles with the series. The first involves something over which the editors had no control. I refer to the fact that, in the first few volumes (particularly Volume One,) Grant's descendants insisted that certain passages in Grant's letters to his fiancee-turned-wife Julia Dent that had been crossed out (either by Julia or other family members) not be published. This idiotic decision is not only extremely frustrating for the reader, but, ironically, damaging to Grant himself. By all accounts, the deleted passages contain nothing that could be considered detrimental to Grant's good name, but by leaving them out, these descendants unwittingly gave the impression that there was something to hide. Hopefully, in an \"Appendix\" volume at the end of the series, the editors will be sporting enough to include whatever deleted passages can be transcribed, and the series will at last be considered complete.My other complaints about this series are more minor. While each volume contains copious, and frequently illuminating, footnotes, the editors occasionally fail to provide enough context. That is to say, a brief, undetailed letter of Grant's will frequently be followed by several pages of footnotes providing other letters and documents on the same subject, without giving much information explaining what, exactly, it all meant. The reader who is not already fully informed on the subject being addressed is sometimes left feeling confused about what exactly is being discussed, and what its relevance may have been.Another drawback is, simply, the price. While these books are certainly handsomely--and obviously expensively--printed and bound, those of us who study history as a hobby rather than as a profession could wish for editions that were more cheaply done, and thus more affordable. Unless you are fortunate enough to have access to a good academic library, these extremely expensive (even when you buy second-hand) volumes are simply out-of-reach for many people. That's a great pity, because in these books is an \"insider's view\" of Grant that does not fully come across in any regular biography.\"}"}]}

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.

Enjoy!\"It's ironic that a book praising intuition would arise and become popular just when many organisations are relying heavily on analytics, but then perhaps that's part of its romantic appeal. It is fun and persuasive, but it doesnt make clear that intuition is only appropriate under what circumstances. The author is undoubtedly correct, for example, that human beings evolved a capability to make accurate and quick decisions about each other's personality and intentions, and it's rare for formal analysis to do that as well. Yet even the author argues that intuitions is a good guide to action only when it's backed by many years of expertise. Any many of the author's examples of intuition are only possible because of years of analytical research in the background, such as Dr. John Gottsman's rapid and seemingly intutitive judgements of whether a married couple he observes will stay together. He's only able to make such assessment because he observed and statistically analyzed thousands of hours of videotaped intactions by couples. It's also clear that decision makers have to use intuition when they have no data and must make a very rapid decision - as in the author's example of police officers deciding whether to shot a suspect.\" pg13-14\"}"}]}

Which is to say, it's not saying much. Now, it is very difficult for a reviewer such as myself to read and review this book without pounds of prejudice weighing on my head. I'll be perfectly honest with you: I am a librarian. One of the thousands that took offense when Madonna announced that her reason for writing children was as follows: \"Now I'm starting to read to my son, but I couldn't believe how vapid and vacant and empty all the stories were\". Presumably Madonna must've been reading the latest \"Dora the Explorer\" to her son. Or perhaps she had been given a copy of \"Love You Forever\". In any case, this inane reason for writing some picture books of her own spawned some of the foulest bits of treacle ever to grace the shelves of bookstores and libraries worldwide. If you think \"Rainbow Fish\" sends a poorly spelled out message, I assure you that it has NOTHING when compared to Madonna's hokey schmaltz-fest \"Mr. Peabody's Apples\".So as you can see, I'm not exactly an unbiased reader. Still, \"Yakov and the Seven Thieves\" looked different from her other stories. Unlike \"The English Roses\" (moral: Pretty people are nice too) and \"Mr. Peabody's Apples\" (moral: In small town America, gossip is naughty) this story looked a little classier. It was written as a fable (good), with a delightful illustrator at the helm (good) and some really original elements in terms of characters and descriptions (very good). Then I got to the end of the tale and the whole kerschmazzle blew up in my face. Though she definitely starts strong and has a good idea of what her plot shoudl be, in the end \"Yakov and the Seven Thieves\" is still weakety weak weak.In this tale, there was once a poor cobbler named Yakov. Yakov had a single son whom he loved very very much. Unfortunately the boy was often sickly and weak. In desperation, Yakov searched out the wisest man in town, an older gentleman who lived with his grandson alone. The wise man hears Yakov's problem and attempts to pray to God to save Yakov's son. This doesn't go particularly well and Yakov is distraught. In a moment of inspiration, the wise man tells his grandson to gather the most despicable thieves in town and bring them to his home. The seven thieves comes (apparently thieves are religious at heart) and when asked by the old man to pray for Yakov's son. They do so, the son is miraculously cured, and a sappy message about how the thieves were symbolically opening the gates of heaven sums the book up. Then there's an odd tacked on ending in which a thief named Boris the Barefoot Midget returns the grandson's stolen shoes and, when told he can keep them, scurries down the road. The end.I'm a big big fan of a well told folktale and for quite some time Madonna was doing really well on this story. She has a nice section at the beginning about how Yakov enjoyed the scenery of his home, \"the magical forests, the crystal-clear streams, and the majestic snowcapped mountains that rose before him in the distance\". She does especially well when describing the different thieves (with the possible exception of the somewhat offensive Boris the Barefoot Midget). But Madonna isn't particularly good at summarizing the morals of her tales. Though it sounds funny to hear it, Madonna is the preachiest children's author I've ever read, outside of Christian fiction itself. If you're into incredibly didactic religious picture books, methinks \"Yakov\" is for you. The book ends happily because the thieves, afraid that the wise old man is magical and potentially dangerous (\"Was he a wizard?... Did he have magical powers?\") suddenly decide that because he's sincere (they're bad guys... but not too bad) they should pray for a little sick boy they've never seen.Some people will be very touched by this tale. Others will find themselves stumbling a little over the stilted language employed (I dare you to find a single contraction in this entire book). Still more will enjoy the book, get to the ending, and find themselves uncomfortable with its overly earnest preaching. Now, the illustrations in this puppy are fan-freakin'-tastic, no question. They're beautifully rendered and bring a lifelike vibrancy to the various sundry thieves. My favorite shot in this tale, bar none, is the picture of the Angel of Death hovering over the sleeping sick lad. This is a gorgeous tale to flip through. If you'd like to just buy the book and cut out the pictures to frame on your wall, that would undoubtedly be the best use of this creation. Just don't bother reading it or anything.I'm being rather harsh, I admit. As I mentioned before, I'm biased. I don't know how much a biased review is worth to you. But as long as you understand exactly where I'm coming from, this review should give you some kind of an indication as to how good or bad Madonna's third book is. I have said that it's the best of the three she's written so far. Still, if you want a picture book that tells a didactic fable about faith in a cold Russian land, try the Caldecott winning (and mind-blowingly illustrated) \"Baboushka and the Three Kings\" by R. Robbins. If you want a picture book that tells an amusing and original folktale, try the outrageous \"Swamp Angel\" by Anne Isaacs (more of a tall tale than a folktale admittedly) or the fabulous \"It Could Always Be Worse\" by Margot Zemach. And if you want a picture book written by a pop star with seemingly little experience writing good books for children but that is just a tinge more saccharine than is comfortable, try the tepid, \"Yakov and the Seven Thieves\".\"}"}]}

After thinking about this book for some time, I think I can be fair.Engh's basic point is that a photographer who wants to make money with his photographs will sell from stock to markets that are not competitive. He then tells the aspiring stock photographer how to determine what those markets are, how to find the photo buyers in those markets and how to deal with those buyers to get your stock photographs sold. Although I'm not a stock photographer most of the steps he advises have a ring of truth to them and agree with what the stock photographers I know tell me.But if you are interested in \"landscapes, birds, scenics, insects, plants, wildflowers, major pro sports, silhouettes, experimental photography, artistic subjects, (such as the \"art\" photography in photography magazines), abstracts (such as those seen in photo-art magazines and salons), popular travel spots, monuments, landmarks, historic sites, [and] cute animals\" Engh says forget about them. Well, maybe that's too strong. He says when you put those areas on the back burner, \"you'll stop wasting time, film, postage, and materials.\" When I came to this advice, I almost put the book down, because it was clear that Engh wasn't talking to me. Most people take photographs because they are interested in some subject matter or approach and not just to make money.I also was disturbed by how often in the book the author shilled for his company and web-site, where, he says, useful information is available. It may be, but it appears it's always for a price.In summary, if all you want to do is make money with your camera, without joy or pleasure, this book may be for you.\"}"}]}

While the book is largely his own perspective, it is a valuable one given his life experience and ability to convey complex topics in easy to understand terms. It certainly got my attention!If you are looking to read your first book on Buddhism or Existentialism, this is probably not for you. However, if you are familiar to one or both of these topics and/or are looking to understand the human condition more deeply, then you will not be disappointed at the ideas presented here.For me, this was a two sitting book that completely engaged me. I have read many books on Buddhism and Existentialism and thought this had a lot to offer a modern person in terms of making Buddhism relevant to modern contexts. I also found it a useful and sensitive exploration of the nature of loneliness and the limitations of the human condition. Among other things, it poignantly expressed how loneliness and the reality of our ultimate death could help us deepen our experience of reality through relationship and fuller engagement with life.\"}"}]}

P. Mallory']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS is essential reading for those interested in the people who spoke the ancestor of most tongues of Europe and western Asia. While scholars have carefully reconstructed a proto-language, the identity of its speakers and their geographical origin remain a mystery, and J.P. Mallory shows what is currently thought in the field.Mallory begins by tracing the historical development of European comparative linguistics, and then examines the various branches of the Indo-European language family first in Asia, then in Europe. However, the most useful portion of the book begins when Mallory attempts to reconstruct as well as one can the actual cultural and social traits of the Indo-Europeans based on the proto-language they spoke. He shows how horses must have been very important within such a culture, asserts that the people must have lived within certain geographical boundaries based on their common vocabulary, and even postulates Proto-Indo-European religious rituals. Unlike Watkin's HOW TO KILL A DRAGON, Mallory does not give much space to concepts of comparative Indo-European poetics.The last third of Mallory's work is concerned with the Indo-European homeland problem, the eternal conundrum for those who would apply comparative linguistics to actual archaeology. Mallory favours the Russian steppes or Ukraine, as do most scholars, and argues quite well against the usual alternative theory of an Anatolian origin. I felt, however, that his placement of the Indo-Europeans could have been more substantial than it was if he had worked in more evidence of contact with speakers of the Uralic languages.A downside of the book is that, while Mallory's entire topic is based on linguistic reconstruction, there is no passion for linguistics in this book. I was unhappy to see, for example, that while Mallory is well aware of laryngeal discoveries, he has chosen to give the older reconstructions of PIE roots in the interest of pronouncability. I don't think the benefits outweight the appearance of datedness and quaintness.While introductions to comparative Indo-European linguistics abound, there are few volumes like IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS which apply reconstruction to substantial archeological exploration. Mallory's work should certainly be read by anyone interested in larger applications of Indo-European philology. I should note that this book should not be approached by the layman unfamiliar with comparative linguistics, and that a work like Szeremenyi's INTRODUCTION TO INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS is a necessary prequisite.\"}"}]}

One night, a bizarre, electronic oscillation pulsed through the bone deep quiet of the Montana air, coming in disturbing waves, accompanied by the sense of an alien presence. An amber radiance resonated through the pine woods surrounding the ranch. Lasting only seven minutes, the phenomena disappeared, only to return a month later in an even more disquieting fashion. Louder, with more rhythmic pounding, it caused the house to vibrate. An undulation of sound lured Eduardo out of his home, where a luminescent amber radiance once again emanated from the woods, calling out to him, the sense of an alien presence overwhelming.

Having proved that they can do almost anything better than men, many women still feel unfulfilled and disillusioned with the promises of feminism. Why? In this uplifting book Toltec seer Th\u00e9un Mares explains how women have been tricked into adopting male patterns, behaviour and logic that can never bring them lasting happiness. He reveals how success for a female is totally different to success for a male. This book shows how women can get back in touch with their true feelings concerning their femininity, how they can reconnect with their individual purpose in life, and recapture the excitement, spontaneity and vitality that lead to enduring fulfilment as a true female.\", \"authors\": \"['Th\u00e9un Mares']\", \"publisher\" : \"Lionheart Pub\", \"text\" : \"UNVEIL THE MYSTERIES OF THE FEMALE BY THEUN MARES A REVIEW BY ANTHONY GAGLIANOThis is a controversial book. This will be especially true for those readers who grew to adulthood during a time when the woman's movement has forced all of us to reconsider previously held views concerning the role of women in civilized society. But the battle for equality and an end to male dominance leaves one important question left unanswered: What is the true relationship between men and women? Are we &quot;equal&quot; or complimentary? Is the universe unisexual? Is androgyny the new ideal for the new age? Are there no differences between male and female beyond the obvious physical distinctions? These are the questions Toltec seer and author Theun Mares answers in Unveil the Mysteries Of The Female. But not everyone will happy with those answers. According to Mr. Mares, a Toltec Nagal of the third attention, men create and women nurture. Furthermore, he asserts that only by supporting the male in her life can a woman achieve her feminine potential. Equally controversial is the idea that in a relationship, whether professional or romantic, it is the male who, as an arbiter of the known, must provide the lead. While this may all seem archaic, these statements are all compatible with the tenets of the world's major religions, none of which espouse androgyny as an ideal. As I said, this is a controversial and thought provoking book, one that will make many a woman think about using it for the purpose of starting a bonfire. The male reader, however, if he is brave enough or foolish enough as the case may be, might wish to consider giving a copy Mr. Mare's book as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his significant female other.

Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it.

Unlike other XML books, this one is packed with hundreds of real-world examples, fully tested and ready to use! Holzner teaches you XML like no other author can, covering every major XML topic today and detailing the ways XML is used now--connecting XML to databases (both locally and on web servers), stying XML for viewing in today's web browsers, reading and parsing XML documents in browsers, writing and using XML schemas, creating graphical XML browsers, working with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and a great deal more. Real World XML is designed to be the standard in XML coverage--more complete, and more accessible, than any other. \"The author's approach is definitely bottom up, written in a highly personable tone. He makes efficient use of example code, which sets this book apart from many I have read in the past. His examples bring to life the code without overwhelming the reader, and he does not present any examples for which the reader has not been prepared. In addition, no prior knowledge of XML is assumed. As such, this is an excellent book for both beginners and intermediate level web designers and programmers. Experts, too, will find this book of value, due to its emphasis on real world applicability. Overall, this book will benefit all web developers and programmers, with a special emphasis on beginner and intermediate developers.\"--Donna A. Dulo, MS, MA, Senior Systems Engineer, U.S. Department of Defense \"This book will provide a brilliant basis for anyone wishing to keep up to speed with the new XML developments.\"--Mr. Andrew Madden, Department of Computer Science, University of Wales \"I found this book's strengths to be: its exhaustive specification reference for the conscientious developer; access to the official specs, which is key; the wide variety of choices provided for all aspects of XML; several alternatives provided for each editor, browser, parser, stylesheet transform engine, and programming language; and working examples that show the power of the tools used.\"--Jaime Ryan, Software Developer/Documentation Manager, Blue Titan Software\", \"authors\": \"['Steven Holzner']\", \"publisher\" : \"Peachpit Press\", \"text\" : \"This is the second edition of Holzner's book, which was originally titled Inside XML. I purchased Inside XML back in 2001 when I first started exploring XML, and it was a good choice back then. Looking at the new version of the book, my opinion hasn't changed. It's still a good choice.Holzner assumes little programming knowledge in his writing. The JavaScript and Java chapters dealing with XML each start with a very high-level tutorial on the language. It's enough to allow you to understand how XML processing can fit in that environment. Throughout the entire book, there is an abundance of examples that you can study and use to get you up and running quickly. To me, the value of this book is how it gives you a great overview of all the pieces of XML as well as example code to make it all come together.Perhaps the only &quot;drawback&quot; to this book is how much it tries to cover. Looking at the table of contents, you see that XML is actually a number of technologies that are used in conjunction with each other. You could easily buy individual books that are more comprehensive in coverage for any one of these related technologies, like SOAP, XSL, or Cascading Style Sheets. Conversely, you would get so bogged down in the minute details that you'd miss the bigger picture of how they all fit together. This book gives you more than enough information to get started, as well as helping you to understand what it is you still don't know.For Notes/Domino developers, this is a perfect title to use to get started on XML technology. You will likely find yourself at some point having to either read or produce an XML file for exchange with another business entity. This book will help you to understand what you need to know to get it done. You could use the Java examples in order to code Domino agents to process XML, and those same examples could also help you to understand some of the LotusScript XML classes that are now provided in Notes/Domino. The SOAP chapters will also be valuable should you have to learn to use and/or create web services for your application.ConclusionIf you are a beginning or intermediate developer who needs to learn the basics of XML in a hurry, this is a very good choice. If you need in-depth knowledge of any particular part of XML, you could supplement this choice with a specific book on that subject. Recommended.\"}"}]}

A full-length recounting of Puccini's fascinating life, rich in previously unused materials, is followed by detailed analyses of each of his operas and other compositions. The author, a Viennese conductor and musicologist, has performed this monumental task with knowledge, grace, and insight. The biography brings to life a curious, somewhat ambiguous man whose greatly successful career was marked alternately by storms, tragedies, and triumphs, a genius who somehow missed the final greatness. His relations with his family, colleagues, librettists, singers, conductors--and his peculiar, convoluted relationship with his wife--have some of the very drama that has made his operas so enduringly popular. Puccini's letters are quoted extensively, many of them in English for the first time. The opera analyses, constantly evaluating the music in terms of drama and libretto, are unique in musical literature and in their completeness and illumination. They are, furthermore, judicious and soundly musical, for instead of accepting ready-made opinions (many of which are quoted), they go directly to the scores themselves.\", \"authors\": \"['Mosco Carner']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"Music was embedded in Puccini; behind him, he had five generations of musical history relating to his family. When his father died, Giacomo was only five years old, and the family ruled that his uncle was suitable enough to handle the child's upbringing - as was the custom then prevailing in Lucca (Italy). Unfortunately the uncle considered little Puccini undisciplined, with a bad taste, concerned more about his looks, materialistic, and a bad organizer. So much labelling heaped on an infant of five.!!!Mosco Carner made of Puccini a fascinating subject for study. \"\"an artist who bore the authentic stamp of genius but who for some reason failed to cross the boundary into the realm of absolute greatness. If there was ever a 'border- line case', it is Puccini.'\"\". The author, in my opinion, has been able in his third edition - posthumously though as it is, and thanks to his wife Hazel - to see all the relevant data in the context of meaningful relationship to historical events, and to value his achievements devoid of personal feelings or bias to 'old' political aberrations.This is extremely interesting.We can see that, unlike Wagner, Puccini did not participate in the dominating politics in his days. Mussolini claimed that Puccini applied for admission to the National Fascist Party. This appears to be highly improbable in the absence of records or proofs of any application signed by Giacomo Puccini and submitted to the party. In addition, had Puccini done so, his close friend Toscanini (the linchpin anti-fascist) would, very likely, have severed all friendly connections with him and refrained from conducting his operas? In fact Puccini's personality could not have possibly accommodated for any delinquent demands from the Fascist Party.Puccini was very attractive, vivacious and also impulsive. The great composer did not care for criticism and this trait interfered with his artistic ambitions bordering on playing with fate.But early on, \"\"Fate\"\" played its role, and played it very well. In his adulthood Puccini took the position of church organist and choir master in Lucca. From such initial experience he adored music, yet it did not become part of him until he saw a performance of Aida (Verdi) that made a sort of divine influence on him to become an opera composer. At the age of 21, he composed the Messa, which marks the culmination of his family's long association with Church Music.The power of the church and the humble prayers of its congregations drew the roadmap for Puccini's works. The acclaim and `Bravo' clapping in appreciation gave glimpses of the moving and vivid power that he would soon release on the stage; hence his powerful \"arias\" for tenor and bass soloists. Certainly Puccini's music in its orchestration and dramatic impact is more operatic than is current in church music. Perhaps one can go thus far to mention that Puccini's Messa compares quite well with Verdi's Requiem.Like Mahler's experience long before, Puccini's initial participation in a competition did not go well. In 1882 he obtained a Libretto and tried his luck for a One-Act opera but did not win. Three years later his next stage caught the attention of Giulio - the owner of his family music publishers: Ricordi & Co - In 1889, Giulio commissioned Puccini with a second opera - Edgar.His third opera - Manon Lescaut 1893 - was his first great success, followed by La Boheme - 1896, Tosca 1900, and Madame Butterfly 1904.Tosca in particular remains a milestone in Puccini's career. Tosca is by far the most historical opera and one of the most popular and significant event ever written and staged. \"\"Tosca is set in a very specific time and place: Rome, from just before midday on June 17, 1800 to a few minutes after dawn on the following day. Any opera lover lucky enough to go to Rome can literally follow in the footsteps of Tosca, from the basilica of Saint Andrea della Valle, to the Farnese Palace , to the fortress of Saint Angelo... history in Tosca is distorted by nationalism and by the vehement anticlerical perceptions of papal Rome shared by Sardou, Puccini and the librettists\"\"Fate struck Puccini's destinies and the industrial revolution played its role in his life, perhaps it has even distracted him. His compositions became less frequent. His passion for driving fast cars nearly killed him in a serious accident in 1903.Fate decreed again.In 1909, there was scandal when Puccini's wife, Elvira, falsely accused their maid Doria Manfredi of having an affair with her husband. The maid then committed suicide. Elvira was successfully sued by the maid's family and Giacomo had to pay damages. Finally, in 1912, the death of Giulio Ricordi, now Puccini's editor and publisher, ended a productive period of his career. However, Puccini completed more works but of little significance compared with the former four operas.Perhaps his worst habit was cigar heavy chain smoking. Towards the end of 1923 Puccini began to complain of chronic sore throats. A diagnosis of throat cancer was ruled. Puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer had progressed. Only his son knew of the seriousness of his father's condition. Puccini's perpetual pain and suffering led his doctors to recommend a trip to Brussels to undergo experimental radiation therapy treatment.Uncontrolled bleeding and complications caused him chronic heart attack. Puccini died in Brussels on November 29, 1924. News of his death travelled fast to Rome during a performance of La boh&egrave;me. The opera was immediately ended, and the orchestra played Chopin's Funeral March . The blow stunned a full-house audience.Like Mahler's tenth Symphony, Puccini's Turandot - his last opera - was left unfinished. The remaining two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches made out in illegible handwriting, difficult or impossible to read. Now still an open question whether Alfano followed the sketches or not? The sketches were said to be an open riddle, indecipherable!!\"\"When Arturo Toscanini conducted the premiere performance in April 1926, (in front of a sold-out crowd, with every prominent Italian except for Benito Mussolini in attendance), he had chosen not to perform Alfano's portion of the score. The performance reached the point where Puccini had completed the score, at which time Toscanini stopped the orchestra. The conductor turned to the audience and said: \"Here the opera finishes, because at this point the Maestro died\". (Some recorded he said, more poetically, \"Here the Maestro laid down his pen.\").\"\"Puccini died at 66; too soon !! our beloved Opera Magician was still young.\"}"}]}

With great clarity and sensitivity, this groundbreaking book from Dr. Evelyn Bassoff, acclaimed psychologist and author of Mothers and Daughters, explains how mothers can remain nurturing presences in their sons' lives throughout their many transitions. She details the important role a father plays in a son's growth, and how mothers can support and celebrate their sons' masculine energy -- whether it manifests itself in a love of playing football or playing piano. Dr. Bassoff also illuminates the varied demands of raising sons for married and single mothers, stepmothers, and mothers of gay sons. Drawing upon the best available research, as well as myths, legends, her experience raising her own son, and the personal stories of clients and friends, Dr. Bassoff offers an invaluable perspective on what mothers can do to insure that their sons become vital, loving men.\", \"authors\": \"['Evelyn S. Bassoff']\", \"publisher\" : \"Plume\", \"text\" : \"While some might object to the overarching psychoanalytic tone, there is a lot to learn and enjoy here as the author incorporates personal experience, anecdotes, research and mythology into her account of the relationship between mothers and sons. I liked her early statement that having a son had moved her from a rigidly feminist position toward one that is more flexible and humanistic. The first section discusses the traits that are uniquely male, and contains chapters on male energy, male role models, male separation and love & sex. I thought this was particularly informative. The second section deals with various special relationships -- shared parenting, single mothers, stepmothers and gay sons. Final chapters deal with the mature relationship between mothers and sons.The author writes from experience and with compassion, and this is a worthwhile book for mothers (and sons) to read.\"}"}]}

They do not need to be supplemented by the existence of the visible world and human beings.But God is also the divine timeless Dimension. In the timeless non-manifest Dimension, God does not have the opportunity to experience the dynamic moral experiences which require the interactions of individual embodied beings in a visible world where they can make moral decisions and perform morally good deeds. Thus, God's purity and moral excellence are non-dynamic in the timeless dimension. This is God's natural ontological attribute and not a shortcoming.Thus God decided to create this visible world and individuate His cosmic consciousness into small units and live in each human being to undergo trials, suffering and spiritual cultivation. This is to enable God to experience and acquire dynamic moral goodness and excellence in the visible world.\"}"}]}

We laugh in self-defense.\u201d\u2014Atlantic Monthly\", \"authors\": \"['Kurt Vonnegut']\", \"publisher\" : \"Dial Press\", \"text\" : \"Despite having read \"Cat's Cradle\" years ago, I recently found myself drawing a blank over the novel. I recalled that it was a 1960s doomsday satire (like Dr. Strangelove), a religious satire about a fake religion called Bokononism, and a political satire about a U.S. backed Caribbean dictatorship, San Lorenzo. Yet I couldn't quite recall what exactly Vonnegut was trying to say in this one, so I decided to reread it.The first theme of this book consists of Vonnegut's warnings about the awesome destructive force of science, and the abdication of moral responsibility by scientists. The plot centers around the deceased scientist Felix Hoenniker, a researcher at the General Forge and Foundry Company of Ilium, New York (modeled on Vonnegut's experiences at General Electric in Schenedtady), and winner of the Nobel Prize (\"dynamite money\"). Hoenniker was the father of the atomic bomb, and as if that isn't enough guilt for one man's soul (\"how the hell innocent is a man who helps make a thing like an atomic bomb?\"), he was also the developer of 'Ice-9', a form of ice with an elevated melting point. As Ice-9 has the potential to freeze the world's oceans, it is an even greater threat to humanity than the atom bomb. To Vonnegut, Hoenikker, and modern science and industry \"receive honors and creature comforts while escaping human responsibilities.\"The second major theme of Cat's Cradle is an exploration of false ideology. This is signified with the title string-trick, in which there is \"no damn cat, no damn cradle\". The book centers around a fabricated religion designed to give the impoverished people sustenance - one might say the opium of the masses, based around useful lies, or \"foma'. Bokononism is itself sharply critical of the meaningless \"granfaloons\" that we use to divide and categorize people, including \"the Communist Party, the Daughers of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company... and any nation, anytime, anywhere\". Cornell University is another such granfaloon, as are \"Hoosiers\". Vonnegut is, as always, particularly derisive of American nationalism and militarism (e.g. \"Fort Jesus\"). Much of this criticism is conveyed through the unusual American Ambassador to San Lorenzo, Horlick Minton (\"Perhaps when we remember wars we should take off all our clothes and... go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns\"). And, as usual for Vonnegut, there are a number of jabs at capitalist ideology, mainly through the character of H. Lowe Crosby, who is in the process of relocating his bicycle factory to San Lorenzo, whose workers are impoverished and sufficiently terrified of the capital punishment doled out by dictator \"Papa\" Monzano, courtesy of \"the hook\". \"No Communists here,\" said Papa. \"They fear the hook too much.\" Bokononism is also a hook-worthy offense. Or more accurately, \"Hy-u-ook-kuh!\"I suppose the third major theme is Vonnegut's absurdist outlook on human existence. Says Bokonon: \"Dyot meet mat\", or \"God made mud\", \"So God said to some of the mud, 'Sit up!'\", \"What interesting other kinds of sitting up mud I met!\" Yet Vonnegut's humanism occasionally shines through the bleak outlook: \"Think of what a paradise this world would be if men were kind or wise.\"\"}"}]}

The rest of the series includes Stone of Tears, Blood of the Fold, Temple of the Winds, Soul of the Fire, Faith of the Fallen, The Pillars of Creation, Naked Empire, Chainfire, Phantom, and Confessor. There is another novel this is and isn't tied into the series called Debt of Bones. Terry Goodkind has written two other novels; The Omen Machine and The Law of Nines. The Sword of Truth series was adapted into a television series called The Legend of the Seeker that ran from 2009 to 2010 for two seasons. Wizard's First Rule was released in August 1994 and published by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC.Richard Cypher was an ordinary woods guide, but after look for answers to his father's murder, he comes to the aid of a woman being chased by a group of men. After helping the strange woman, Kahlan, she tells Richard that she must find the Old Mage to save the Midlands from D'Hara and Darken Rahl. After bringing Kahlan to his old friend, Zedd, he is shocked to learn that he is the wizard that Kahlan is looking for. However, they are all shocked when Zedd names him Seeker and finds himself in a situation that he would never have thought to be in.Criticisms:1) Originality. Wizard's First Rule's most noticeable issue is that the story, characters, premise, and setting rely on a lot of science fiction and fantasy clich&eacute;s and tropes. These issues don't hurt the story overall, but they are painfully obvious and can cause the story to be predictable. The only real bad thing about this is that when the story tries to be more original, it doesn't stray too far from those clich&eacute;s and tropes. It treads the beaten path of familiar territory, and doesn't really leave it for too long. That is the most frustrating thing about Wizard's First Rule. It can't remain original. How many times has there been a young man who lost his family, mentored by an old man in a way of an unknown force with the help of a strong female counterpart to help stop evil? That's really the main premise of Wizard's First Rule. Thankfully, it does add-on to that particular trope, but only really adds on with more clich&eacute; situations and premises. It does all make sense and comes together in the end, but it still comes off as clich&eacute;d. This lack or fear of originality does have a negative impact.Praises:1) Characters. Wizard's First Rule has a vast cast of characters and they are surprisingly easy to remember. Almost all the characters, aside from one or two, have distinct qualities and personalities. The three protagonists, Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, are decent characters, but are a bit generic. Richard is a decent character that is likable, but feels like he didn't really develop. He does have some development, but it only skims the surface. Kahlan was an interesting character. She came off as strong, intelligent, and likable. However, she becomes trapped into fawning over Richard for most of the story. It does weaken her character, and makes her feel slightly insignificant. She's still is a fun and likable character, but she felt weaker as the story went on. Zedd was probably the most interesting character. He never felt underdeveloped and always seemed erratic. You never really knew what he was up to. That isn't saying that the main characters were mediocre, they were just fairly generic. They had endearing qualities that made you like them and as the story went on, you did get to know them better. For being the first book in a series, you need characters who you can grow to like and you do grow to like these characters. On the flip side, we have the antagonists. You knew they were bad as soon as they were introduced. This does hurt them in a way, but it was easy to find yourself growing to despise these guys and hoping that the protagonists will win. But the most impressive thing is that there are a lot of characters and you knew each one. There wasn't a character who you forget. It was easy to recall who was who. Everyone felt distinct and unique in their own little way that allowed them to be remembered. That's the most impressive thing.2) Dark. Wizard's First Rule takes a lot of dark twists throughout the story, but it's never overly explicit in these times. Most of the darker situations are hinted at but never really explored deeper. The only dark element that is explored is when Richard is tortured late in the story, but even then it's subdued and leaves a lot left for the reader's imagination. Aside from torture, the story also brings up child abuse, pedophilia, rape, murder, fetishes, kidnapping, infanticide, among a vast amount of others. But before this turns off the average reader, nothing is really direct spoken about these things. Instead it's implied and directly never really shown. It's brought up, but hardly ever goes past being talked about. On a personal level, I like dark subject matter in fantasy. It gives it a more 'realistic' feeling to it, instead of \"hero goes off and saves everyone, and everyone lives happily ever after.\" It just gives it more impact. The darker tone really contrasts the happy moments, reminding the reader that things always aren't always happy and that heroes do fail. This what makes Wizard's First Rule memorable because you honestly start to believe that Darken Rahl is going to win, and the heroes will lose. This gives the story a hopeless feeling that wasn't expected. The darker tones helps make Wizard's First Rule feel different.3) Pacing. Wizard's First Rule was paced exceptionally well. It's one of those novels where if you're not careful, you'll lose yourself in the pages and find out that five hours have passed. It's not overly fast, but it's never too slow. The pacing slows down when it's needed, and picks up when things are happening. It doesn't become overly descriptive and leaves a lot to the reader's imagination, which helps with the pacing allowing the story to not be bogged down for too long. The pacing was just that good.Side Notes:1) Tears. Why does it feel like everyone cries on every other page in this story? It becomes slightly annoying after reading that Richard or Kahlan has tears in their eyes for the fiftieth time.2) Oddities. There were a few times in the story that something felt 'odd'. For example, why cut away from Rachel being saved or why did it feel like Richard never really felt that effected by the torture at the hands of a Mord-Sith? It just seems like things were cut out.3) Cover Art. Currently there are three different covers for Wizard's First Rule. The original cover shows Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and a red dragon behind a golden city. This version looks like a generic fantasy novel cover, but the bright reds and golds do catch the eye. Unfortunately, it does hurt the eyes after staring at it for too long. The newer version features the live action Richard and Kahlan from The Legend of the Seeker television show. This one is okay, but looks standard and a bit too dark. The version I have shows a wonderful landscape with a waterfall being the center of attention. I do prefer this version because it's just gorgeous. The scenery is breathtaking and after taking it all in you finally notice Richard and Kahlan on the stone. It's a nice contrast to most fantasy covers.Overall: 5/5Final Thoughts:Wizard's First Rule is a great story, even if you've read it before. While it's not all that original and borrows from many science fiction and fantasy clich&eacute;s, it still blends them together into a fun experience. The main characters, while a bit weak, were interesting and fun enough for you to like them. They are likable characters and you find yourself wanting to discover more about them. For the amount of characters in Wizard's First Rule, you can easily remember who is who. Each character was unique and distinctive. Wizard's First Rule is surprisingly dark at times. There is a lot of dark subject matter brought up, but it's never overly explicit, only implied. The dark subject matter allows for a more realistic and deeper story. Wizard's First Rule is a fun and fast read. There never was any slow moments that ground the story to a halt, nor was there any fast moments that left you wondering what happened. If you aren't careful, you can lose hours while reading. Wizard's First Rule isn't for everyone. It may be too generic for some, too dark for others, but it's worth checking out.\"}"}]}

I will admit there were a couple areas in this audio book that somewhat dragged a little and there were other parts where Linda Stephens' voice dramatized a little too far.Margaret Mithchell wrote a breathtaking novel of true passion combined with the overwhelming heartache and the meaning of love in it's finest. And Linda Stephens brings out the roll of each charactor, each with a pitch of their own.Chapter by chapter leads out the fall of selfishness, the depth of passion and the power one has in the will to correct. Gone With the Wind portrays how one [Scarlett O'Hara], like so many can blind themselves in seeking to gain wealth of money and false imagination - where as it can fool (time and time again) to throw away the richest love one could ever gain.\"}"}]}

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor & Francis, an informa company.\", \"authors\": \"['F.A. Hayek']\", \"publisher\" : \"Routledge\", \"text\" : \"The Road to Serfdom is Hayek's classic exposition of the superiority of individual liberty over central planning. As he does in his other writings, Hayek advocates free enterprise, competition, private property, and limited government.Reading it in 2004, or 60 years after its initial publication, the book comes across somewhat dated. There are many references to World War II--Hayek argues that central planning, communism, socialism, totalitarianism, Naziism, and fascism are all cut from the same cloth, which at the time of its original publication was a sufficient argument, but which is probably less persuasive many years later to collectivists who are not quite Naziis. Indeed, Hayek's subject may at first appear a bit like a strawman, because by now blatant, outright central planning has, for all intents and purposes, been abandoned worldwide, the Berlin Wall has fallen, and no serious thinker any longer advocates communism.Still, at the time the book was published, central planning was very much alive, and the subject was highly relevant indeed. One could easily argue that the book, or at least its ideas, contributed towards the downfall of communism, based on news reports that Eastern European dissidents found inspiration in Hayek's writings. Furthermore, although communism may be dead, socialism is still very much alive at least in Western Europe (where, unlike in the United States, capitalism is almost like a four-letter word and socialism continues to be a respected political-party label). And even in the United States, although it is generally understood that government ownership of the means of production is not desirable, government ownership of the fruits of economic production is still very much a fact (p. xxiii: \"socialism has come to mean chiefly the extensive redistribution of incomes through taxation and the institutions of the welfare state\"; cf. p. xxxiv). But these more subtle forms of central planning are addressed more fully in Hayek's subsequent publications (e.g. The Constitution of Liberty; and Law, Legislation and Liberty).If you read but one book by Hayek, you may be better off with The Constitution of Liberty. But if you want to read several, and trace the shaping of Hayek's ideas, you definitely want to include The Road to Serfdom, if only because it was his first political book, and themes of it can be recognized in the writings of subsequent libertarians. Rosen and Wolff's Oxford Reader in Political Thought quotes pp. 119-124. All in all, it is with reason that The Road to Serfdom is still considered a classic.A final point worth noting: Hayek is frequently credited with the idea that it is the price mechanism as a communicative vehicle of relevant information that makes free markets far more economically efficient than centrally planned economies. The usual citation on this is an article Hayek published in 1945, but The Road to Serfdom, published a year earlier in 1944, contains two paragraphs that make very much the same point in layman's language (pp. 55-56 of the 1994 edition).\"}"}]}

There are two common themes that run through this collection of 7 stories: (1) the writer and his/her place in society, and (2) women living through the complications of their emotional and/or sexual lives in the context of larger societal pressures. These thematic threads give the collection as a whole a pleasing coherence. The stories included are as follows:\"Expiation\": about a woman novelist, this story looks at an intersection point in the worlds of literature and religion. \"The Dilettante\": about a troublesome romantic triangle. \"The Muse's Tragedy\": about the problematic emotional legacy of a respected poet. \"The Pelican\": follows the career of a female lecturer. \"Souls Belated\": about the relationship between a male novelist and a divorced woman. \"Xingu\": a comic tale about a snobby ladies' club that is hosting a woman novelist. \"The Other Two\": the story of a man's relationships with the two ex-husbands of his twice-divorced wife.Wharton is an excellent writer, and her skills are really on full display in this collection. Peppered throughout the stories are a number of memorable (sometimes even Wildean) lines. Example: \"It is always a bad sign when loud people come to a quiet place\" (from \"Souls\"). An ideal choice for literature or women's studies courses (as well as for private reading). Recommended as companion texts: the novel \"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing,\" by May Sarton, and the Dover Thrift Edition of \"Short Stories\" by Theodore Dreiser; both of these fine books share themes in common with this Wharton collection.\"}"}]}

M. Forster, about a young woman in the restrained culture of Edwardian era England. Set in Italy and England, the story is both a romance and a humorous critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. Merchant Ivory produced an award-winning film adaptation in 1985.The Modern Library ranked A Room with a View 79th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century (1998).\"\", \"authors\": \"['E M Forster']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"A Room With A View is one of those light-hearted yet serious books that starts out slowly, begins to warm up, and becomes wonderful toward the end -- leaving one with a warm, happy glow. On the surface, it is a very simple book with a very simple plot and theme -- forbidden love. Indeed, it is not the plot that makes the book so enjoyable; it is the style and the characters. Outside of fiction, E. M. Forster is also well-known for essays on various aspects of literature; he also taught in the English university system. This becomes clear throughout the course of the book; he writes like a literature professor. This accounts for both the slow start and the eventual charm. Always a clever writer (though occasionally too self-consciously so), with tongue never too far from cheek, Forster can definitely turn a phrase -- the penultimate paragraph to one of the later chapters, on Lucy's \"surrender,\" is bone-chillingly good --, and the book is written in a generally light-hearted, jovial way. As another reviewer pointed out, he almost seems to be making fun of his characters at times. Clearly a social critic at heart, Forster shows how what seem like earth-shattering tragedies to Lucy -- the prim, upper-crust heroine -- are, at best, but ripples in the pool. Despite the recurring \"tragedies,\" the mood never gets too dark and heavy; light-hearted chapter titles help perpetuate this feeling. This raises the book above countless similarly-plotted novels. Forster after all created the concept of \"flat\" and \"round\" characters, and as anyone familiar with the terms knows, the former is not a pejorative. Forster stressed that a novel needs both to be balanced and true-to-life. This indeed has them: Lucy, the well-rounded, life-accurate heroine who lives, breathes, and grows; Cecil, the walking caricature. Forster's social criticism must also be remarked on once more. In this social comedy, he deflates Edwardian England's puffed-up, self-important upper-class values and leaves us both charmed and amused. The book's deeper element lies here, as he enlightens us about the hypocrisy and xenophobia. His point should not be missed. These elements come together to bring about a delightful, pleasant, and short read that is likely to please most anyone. This is a well-deserved classic.\"}"}]}

It's about a husband and wife who escape civilization to build a small restaurant on an island paradise -- and discover that even paradise has its pitfalls. It's a story filled with calamities and comedy, culinary disasters and triumphs, and indelible portraits of people who live and work on a sliver of beauty set in the Caribbean Sea. It's about the maddening, exhausting, outlandish complications of trying to live the simple life -- and the joy that comes when you somehow pull it off. The story begins when Bob and Melinda Blanchard sell their successful Vermont food business and decide, perhaps impulsively, to get away from it all. Why not open a beach bar and grill on Anguilla, their favorite Caribbean island? One thing leads to another and the little grill turns into an enchanting restaurant that quickly draws four-star reviews and a celebrity-studded clientele eager for Melinda's delectable cooking. Amid the frenetic pace of the Christmas \"high season,\" the Blanchards and their kitchen staff -- Clinton and Ozzie, the dancing sous-chefs; Shabby, the master lobster-wrangler; Bug, the dish-washing comedian -- come together like a crack drill team. And even in the midst of hilarious pandemonium, there are moments of bliss. As the Blanchards learn to adapt to island time, they become ever more deeply attached to the quirky rhythms and customs of their new home. Until disaster strikes: Hurricane Luis, a category-4 storm with two-hundred-mile-an-hour gusts, devastates Anguilla. Bob and Melinda survey the wreckage of their beloved restaurant and wonder whether leaving Anguilla, with its innumerable challenges, would be any easier than walking out on each other. Affectionate, seductive, and very funny, A Trip to the Beach is a love letter to a place that becomes both home and escape.\", \"authors\": \"['Melinda Blanchard', 'Robert Blanchard']\", \"publisher\" : \"Potter Style\", \"text\" : \"This book made me want to quit my job and move to the islands.

His classification of films as \"incoherent,\" \"progressive,\" or \"reactionary\" is pretty random. For example, he derides The Omen as reactionary (which primarly means supportive of a traditional view of the family), completely denying the confusion created by putting pure evil in the form of an infant. His ideas about an ideal society, based on a peculiar form of radical feminism, are given a focus that overrides specifics of particular films he claims to be analyzing. And that form of feminism (in which promiscuous, gay men are the ideal of masculinity) isn't something everyone would consider an appropriate form of feminism. I consider myself a pretty strong feminist, but I see his ideals as a wrong turn at best. He's not always wrong (his analysis of the films with Debra Winger, where the \"liberated\" woman finds happiness by finding a good man, are appropriate), but even when I agree with him, I feel like it's mere coincidence that we hold the same position.Above it says that people who bought this book also bought Carol Clover's \"Men, Women, and Chainsaws.\" That book is infinitely more thoughtful and thought provoking, though it's focus is more specifically on horror films. Wood focuses on horror, but not exclusively.\"}"}]}

However it's not till near the end he finds out and does something about it. And Rand finally....umm...ok I won't say it. But I assume if everything goes accordingly (something could go wrong again because end was abrupt and didn't follow up enough to tell for certain, I guess he wanted people to want to read the next volume.) we won't hear the same whinning about the pain he feels when he touches the Source. Oh yeah now that I think about it, there's one more thing that happens in the middle of the book that's interesting. Let me just say it makes men envy Rand...Anyways not as depressing as few last books certainly and they don't drag on as much. But there are of course a few problems, such as Perrin's disappearance all of a sudden much like the way Mat did in last volume...but that's ok I didn't look forward to hear him whine about his wife missing for the rest of the book...although it was just a delay of inevitable I guess. And Egwene doesn't do much either. So hope for the next book? Don't let characters just disappear, maybe if Jordan got more of them together, not spread all over the place, it won't happen.

His method is exploratory, meandering, personal. He begins by encircling it, first by car then on foot. He finds that the mountain is a complex of moss-bearded hemlocks and old-growth firs, high meadows that blossom according to a precise natural timeclock, sheets of crumbling pumice, fractured glaciers, and unsteady magma. Its snow fields bristle with bug life, and its marmots chew rocks to keep their teeth from overgrowing. Rainier rumbles with seismic twitches and jerks\u2014some one-hundred-thirty earthquakes annually. The nightmare among geologists is the unstoppable wall of mud that will come rolling down its slopes when a hunk of mountain falls off, as it does every half century (and we\u2019re fifty years overdue). Rainier is both an obsession and a temple that attracts its own passionate acolytes: scientists, priests, rangers, and mountain guides. Rainier is also a monument to death: every year someone manages just to disappear on its flanks; imperiled climbers and their rescuers perish on glaciers; a planeload of Marines remains lodged in ice since they crashed into the mountain in 1946. Referred to by locals as simply \"the mountain,\" it is the single largest feature of the Pacific Northwest landscape\u2014provided it isn\u2019t hidden in clouds. Visible or not, though, it\u2019s presence is undeniable.\", \"authors\": \"['Bruce Barcott']\", \"publisher\" : \"Sasquatch Books\", \"text\" : \"Bruce Barcott writes as if you were in the room speaking with him. His style is friendly, to the point (often blunt) descriptive and frequently flowery. He uses such descriptive phrases that I was often left rolling on the floor, tears of laughter flowing from my eyes.It's hard to categorize this book. It's not really about climbing mountains, though there is plenty of that. It's not really about geology, though there is plenty of that as well. It's not about ecology, though ecologists will certainly connect with Barcott, and it's not really about history, even though there are lots of interesting historical tidbits sprinkled throughout the book. The book is sort of a mish mash of all these subjects that Barcott ultimately ties in with the mountain that defines Washington State, and Seattle in particular: Rainier.It's hard to say what part of the book I enjoyed the most. I really enjoyed the stories about the mountain's &quot;real&quot; name. Even though I grew up in Federal Way, Washington I never knew about the battle waged by Tacoma in trying to rename Rainier with it's original (or at least one of them) Indian name. There are other interesting historical footnotes like the military plane carrying marines home for the Christmas holidays that slammed into the mountain. And, of course, there are stories about early climbers like Muir.Barcott describes lots of his hikes around Rainier, particularly the wonderland trail, and he ends the book with an account of his climb to the summit. As it turned out, I had climbed Rainier in June of the same year Barcott climbed it (he climbed in July) and so it was interesting comparing my recollection of the trip with his.Barcott tries hard not to come across as the typical macho, climb-or-die mountaineer. In fact, he has some rather harsh words to say about some of the people who climb - offering physiological analysis that, although insightful and probably close to the mark, is sometimes pretty insulting. But that's Barcott's style - to the point with no BS. I like it.The author presents lots of stuff in the book as factual, but there are no footnotes or chapter endnotes. Consequently, at first I was a little skeptical about how much of the book (especially what appeared to be anecdotal) is just fabricated for its story-telling value. Upon reaching the end of the book, however, I had to conclude that Barcott has probably done his homework and research pretty thoroughly. There is a long list of references (roughly 100) with descriptions about many. Some of the references look pretty good, and I'm probably going to get one or two of them for further reading. The book also has a complete index, which is something the forgetful among us always appreciate.Overall this is a fine book. It's enjoyable, interesting, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes reflective, but always engaging. I read the entire book - all 250 pages - in just a few days. It's a great companion for those cold rainy Northwest nights when there's a log in the fireplace.Duwayne Anderson Saint Helens, Oregon. November 18, 1999\"}"}]}

A lot of philosophers have been talking for the past twenty years about \"Virtue Theory\" as an approach in normative ethics that can rival deontology and utilitarianism for depth, plausibility and coherence. But Hursthouse's book is the first that I'm aware of to attempt a full statement of precisely what it is that makes the approach distinctive. And anyone who's familiar with the work of other philosophers (e.g. Elizabeth Anscombe, John McDowell, Bernard Williams) who've been viewed as the standard-bearers for VT during this period of time will be able to recognize that it's an unqualified success in at least this respect.So, does the book actually make VT seem appealing? Well, there's some excellent stuff on how to distinguish rule-based approaches from character based approaches to ethical evaluation. And there's a wonderfully subtle discussion of precisely how Aristotlelian accounts of the moral significance of a person's motivations differ from those traditionally given by Kantians. There's also some very silly stuff at the end though. Her discussion of the difference between human beings and animals is jaw-droppingly simplistic - really, almost Philistine. Like Foot and McDowell, she fails to register the fact that thousands of very smart people have thought about this subject in zoology, anthropology and biology departments around the world and that it might be at least somewhat worthwhile to take a bit of glance at what they have to say. And at the end she delivers a stunning battery of ad hominems against Bernard Williams for daring to suggest that the Aristotelian notion of a distinctive human function doesn't stand up to careful and impartial scrutiny.Even in these areas, though, what Hursthouse says is far from being out of step with the views propagated by other writers in the VT tradition. If one is left with the slightly disappointing impression that the VT approach might after all be little more than the fetish of a couple of generations of clever, but slightly wooly Oxbridge humanists, it's hard to see how she herself can be blamed for this.\"}"}]}

Lewis, the most important writer of the 20th century, explores the common ground upon which all of those of Christian faith stand together. Bringing together Lewis\u2019 legendary broadcast talks during World War Two from his three previous books The Case for Christianity, Christian Behavior, and Beyond Personality, Mere Christianity provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear this powerful apologetic for the Christian faith.\", \"authors\": \"['C. S. Lewis']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harper Collins\", \"text\" : \"I was not raised a christian, I converted in my mid 20s, alone. This book was recommended to me by my siste4r-in-law, who is a young presbyterian minister in a wealthy part of california.This book screams apologetics. Apologetics has it's place in the realm of christian thought. Mr. Lewis is a profoundly creative person, and he uses his creativity to it's fullest in forming analogies that may or may not be accurate regarding many of the things that both christians and non-christians alike find puzzling or hard to wrap their heads around regarding the christian faith. However, most of the things discussed, and Mr. Lewis admits this freely, also may or may not be true. This doesn't make them useless, they may be very helpful ways of looking at many issues, the point is that their truth or falsity simply doesn't matter in the long run. For example, we may not be able to understand the true nature of the mechanism of salvation, and since the bible doesn't volunteer that information we are free to speculate wildly regarding that mechanism, but our speculations don't make a difference; it is enough that the mechanism (though we don't understand it) does in fact WORK in us.That's the thing, however, about apologetics. It can be fascinating, fascinating even unto the point of dominating the minds of the faithful as a pastime, but that can be troublesome because when you spend too much time with it it can distract you from study of the things in the bible that ARE quite clear and ARE things that god wants us to spend time pondering, studying, meditating on, talking about, sharing, learning, and so forth. C.S Lewis is, self-admittedly, not free to speak authoritatively on theology and exegesis. The things in this book that spring from the creative mind of Lewis, the things that have made this book a classic, the things that can't be found in other books, his quaint observations, his speculations, his easy to digest analogies, those things aren't NECESSARY to anyone's faith, spiritual growth, life. Everything that anyone needs to know about anything comes from the theologian and the exigete. That doesn't mean you spend no time on anything else, or that you become one or the other, but it does mean that you spend at least some time learning at the feet of masters in those fields, and the type of apologetics at which C.S Lewis excels in this work can tempt one to think that to spend time learning from this book is the same thing as growing in faith, and it is not.It is an entertaining read, however. The man is obviously intelligent without speaking down to his readers or using pretentious and difficult to understand language, in fact, anyone can read this book, understand all of it, and enjoy it thoroughly. I enjoyed it. This is a book you read along your faith journey, but then put aside and move on to bigger and better things. As Lewis says himself in the book; If the analogies and explanations of any given concept or issue in this book are helpful to you in your faith or in conceptualizing parts of your spirituality, then feel free to use them, if they don't work for you, feel free to toss them out and don't think about them. What I will add is this; whether you like and use his explanations or not, do not allow yourself to be misled into thinking that it makes a great deal of difference whether he is wrong or right.\"}"}]}

When \"Ender's Game\" was first published as a novella twenty-five years ago few would have predicted that it would become one of the most successful ventures in publishing history. Expanded into a novel in 1985, Ender's Game won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best Novel. Never out of print and translated into dozens of languages, it is the rare work of fiction that can truly be said to have transcended a genre. Ender's Game and its sequels have won dozens of prestigious awards and are as popular today among teens and young readers as adults. First Meetings is a collection of three novellas-plus the original \"Ender's Game\"-that journey into the origins and the destiny of one Ender Wiggin. \"The Polish Boy\" begins in the wake between the first two Bugger Wars when the Hegemony is desperate to recruit brilliant military commanders to repel the alien invasion. In John Paul Wiggin-the future father of Ender -they believe they may have found their man. Or boy. In \"Teacher's Pest\"-a novella written especially for this collection-a brilliant but insufferably arrogant John Paul Wiggin, now an American university student, matches wits with an equally brilliant graduate student named Theresa Brown. It is many years since the end of the Bugger Wars in \"The Investment Counselor.\" Ender's reputation as a hero and savior has suffered a horrible reversal. Banished from Earth and slandered as a mass murderer, twenty-year-old Andrew Wiggin wanders incognito from planet to planet as a fugitive. Until a blackmailing tax inspector compromises his identity and threatens to expose Ender the Xenocide. Also reprinted here is the original landmark novella, \"Ender's Game,\" which first appeared in 1977. Fully illustrated, First Meetings is Orson Scott Card writing at the height of his considerable power about his most compelling character.

It is also considered one of the very best all-time science fiction stories. Besides that superb stand-alone novel, Card has expanded the \"Enderverse\" with numerous sequels and parallel books that have almost universally received high praise from fans and critics alike. This book, FIRST MEETINGS IN ENDER'S UNIVERSE, is a collection of four short novellas that fill in some of the back story of Ender's saga, focusing on key events that helped shape the direction of the overall story, but that had not been previously told. All four of these short stories are very well written, highly entertaining, and should be enjoyed by any fan of the series.Two of the stories tell of Ender's father, John Paul, who as a young man was pressured to join Battle School (as Ender later did), and managed to manipulate -and was manipulated by- the one-world government of the time. My favorite story of this book shows how John Paul met and began courting Ender's mother, a somewhat disgruntled (but genius) graduate-student teacher of his, during his days at University. One other novella here skips to the time between the novelsEnder's GameandSpeaker for the Dead, and shows us how Ender first met Jane, his wonderfully-complex virtual companion of the later Ender novels. This tale proves amusing, but doesn't really add much to the greater story, as we already knew how Jane came to be, and Ender's relationship with the program is central to -and fully explored by- other books.Finally, this volume also contains the original \"Ender's Game\" short story, first published by Analog magazine in 1977. This is the first time I've read the original story, and I found it fantastic. I had been curious about how Card had crammed the fast-paced and intricate story from the novel into such a short piece, and it was really interesting to see what was included and what was initially missing from the story. Obviously, I'd recommend the full novel to those just entering the Enderverse, but for those who wish to make a quick visit to Ender's Game, this short story provides a wonderfully nostalgic experience.While short, this collection of novellas is of excellent quality and content. Fans of the series should be pleased. Highly Recommended!\"}"}]}

Gatsby emerges as if from nowhere, evading questions about his past and throwing dazzling parties sparkling with champagne and jazz at his luxurious Long Island mansion. Nick Carraway, a young man who has moved in next door, is fascinated by his oddly detached neighbor, and by his discovery that Gatsby is motivated by a single-minded quest to regain his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Nick finds something both appalling and appealing about the intensity of Gatsby's ambition to reinvent himself. But Daisy and her wealthy husband are cynical and careless people, and as Gatsby's dream collides with reality, Nick is witness to the violence and tragedy that result. The Great Gatsby's remarkable staying power, nearly a century after its publication, is owed both to the lyrical freshness of its storytelling and to the way that it illuminates the hollow core of the glittering American dream.

Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date \u00d41500,\u00d5 and the name \u00d4Hareton Earnshaw.\u00d5 I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here \u00d4the house\u00d5 pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.\", \"authors\": \"['Emily Bronte']\", \"publisher\" : \"Library of Alexandria\", \"text\" : \"After reading \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Bronte, I knew I had to read her sister's only novel.

Everything that you think is going to happen to the characters pretty much does. Emma's fate and that of her lapdog husband Charles are written in quickly drying cement from the first few chapters. All you can really do is sit back and watch with the sick fascination of an ambulance chaser as their unrelenting boredom, sadness, and unfulfilled dreams suck them swirling to their predestined ends.And yet, this book provides much more than a good wallowing session. Madame Bovary is one of the best written novels I've ever read. Flaubert is a brilliant writer. The characters are so alive in their death-in-life dance that you can't help but sharply feel their pain and see how they might have lived their lives differently.Madame Bovary is a classic of French literature, but it also speaks to our modern condition in an uncanny way. Anyone searching for meaning in their life will relate to the pains and struggles of these characters. If you've been thinking about reading this (I had it waiting on my shelf for about a decade) wait no longer. Read this remarkable novel now.\"}"}]}

The whole magnificent sweep of this great struggle is set against its political background of the Napoleonic wars and the sea war with America. With this narrative come an extraordinary array of young, daring and hugely skilled frigate captains whose ability to grasp the chances offered by war made them household names in this savage age. Some, like Warren, Pellew, Cochrane and Collingwood, are still renowned; others are here rescued from under the shadow of Nelson as the author recounts their brave and brilliant exploits. rnAs well as the thrilling accounts of sea battles and single-ship actions, the author describes the darker side to life at sea \u0096 the constant danger and harsh discipline, the wearying monotony of sea-keeping, the scourges of disease and the occasional outbreaks of mutiny.

Daar leert ze mensen kennen die een heel ander leven leiden en er idee\u00ebn op nahouden die haaks staan op die van haar. Hochschild raakt bevriend met een automonteur, een aannemer, een telefoonreparateur, een handelsreiziger, een vrachtwagenchauffeur, een conci\u00ebrge en een gospelzanger, en probeert te achterhalen waarom zij tegen hun eigen belangen in aanhangers zijn van politici als Donald Trump en op hem stemmen.

It is more of a fictional drama, with aspects of the book an extremely-thinly veiled criticism of organized religion.The story revolves around a human being who was taken in by the Martian race and taught to think and behave like a Martian. The human hero is then brought back to Earth and has to 'learn' what it means to be human. Many interesting statements are made about some of the norms and mores human beings have with regards to their interaction with others.However where the book starts to fall apart is when a pseudo-religeous church is introduced into the book, and from that point on (about half way through), the book stops being sci-fi alltogether and simply turns into the author's diatribe against organized religion. Many terms used to describe the 'church' in the book are first introduced in a circus paradigm -- displaying the contempt the author seems to feel about the subject.Over all, the characters are pretty well developed and the story doesn't have too many confusing points. It flows rather well, but by the reader is left wondering, &quot;How did this story end up here?&quot;For all the hype, I do not think this book lives up to expectations, but it does offer some interesting insight as to how humans might react if/when we meet a species from another planet.

Eliade thus asks the arch-question: \"What can protect us from the terror of history?\"The discussion is framed within a comparison between what Eliade deems as the distinctive difference between the ancient and modern, the archaic (or primitive) and contemporary world-view. The modern envisions reality as a series of events which fulminate in a linear, progressive history - a history which had a beginning and will have an end. The ancient experiences reality as an endless, cyclic repetition of primordial acts. \"... the life of archaic man (a life reduced to the repetition of archetypal acts, that is, to categories and not to events, to the unceasing rehearsal of the same primordial myths) although it takes place in time, does not bear the burden of time, does not record time's irreversibility; in other words, completely ignores what is especially characteristic and decisive in a consciousness of time. Like the mystic, like the religious man in general, the primitive lives in a continual present. (And it is in this sense that the religious man may be said to be a `primitive'; he repeats the gestures of another and, through this repetition, lives always in an atemporal present.)\"Eliade points to the centrality of the lunar cycle in the mythological fabric woven from this perspective, which, to a degree, envelops our own world-view, however linear and eschatologically determinate. \"The phases of the moon - appearance, increase, wane, disappearance, followed by reappearance after three nights of darkness - have played an immense part in the elaboration of cyclical concepts. We find analogous concepts especially in the archaic apocalypses and anthropogonies; deluge or flood puts an end to an exhausted and sinful humanity, and a new regenerated humanity is born, usually from a mythical `ancestor' who escaped the catastrophe, or from a lunar animal.\" Regeneration of humanity is thus always implied in its destruction. In the natural imaging, like the seasons, we assure ourselves, fall and dissolution are ever succeeded by renewal. \"... just as the disappearance of the moon is never final, since it is necessarily followed by a new moon, the disappearance of man is not final either; in particular, even the disappearance of an entire humanity ... is never total ...\" As the modern (historical) cultures translate this concept, \"this optimism can be reduced to a consciousness of the normality of the cyclical catastrophe, to the certainty that it has a meaning and, above all, that it is never final... In the `lunar perspective', the death of the individual and the periodic death of humanity are necessary, even as the three days of darkness preceding the `rebirth' of the moon are necessary. The death of the individual and the death of humanity are alike necessary for their regeneration ... what predominates in all these cosmico-mythological lunar conceptions is the cyclical occurrence of what has been before, in a word, eternal return.\"Due to the fact that the modern, predominantly Western model, of consciousness, primarily informed by Hebraic/Christian-Greek (teleological) influences, perceives time as a matrix for linear progress toward eschatological fulfillment, an end (and Eliade does not hesitate to analyze with his usual acumen - and here one must highlight the amazing passage where he claims that the concept of `ekpyrosis', the destruction of the world by fire, originates in early Iranian mythology - how Islam developed within this eschatological framework), we are forced to confront what he terms \"the terror of history\", the assertion (often stated by zealots of various stripes as fact) that human history, itself, must end. Recognition of this shift in human consciousness, from the archaic celebration of the repetition of nativity to the modern obsession with the limitation of mortality yields enormous explanatory power. In the face of the nuclear option, we must seriously consider how far such concepts as \"resurrection\", \"rebirth\" have tangible reality, not merely a traditionally assigned or contemplatively evoked meaning, but value as real states of affairs.\"Since the `invention' of faith, in the Judeo-Christian sense of the word (= for God all is possible), the man who has left the horizon of archetypes and repetition can no longer defend himself against that terror except through the idea of God . . . Any other situation of modern man leads, in the end, to despair. It is a despair provoked not by his own human existentiality, but by his presence in a historical universe in which almost the whole of mankind lives prey to a continual terror (even if not always conscious of it) . . .In this respect, Christianity incontestably proves to be the religion of `fallen man': and to the extent to which modern man is irremediably identified with history and progress, and to which history and progress are a fall, both implying the final abandonment of the paradise of archetypes and repetition.\" These are the words with which the book concludes. If all that we are is the product of all that has been thought, they deserve the closest sort of reading by every thinking being. For the final abandonment, in the fine sense and print, means no less than the final abandonment of planet earth and the evolutionary project of humanity in full.\"}"}]}

Coetzee\u2019s searing novel tells the story of David Lurie, a twice divorced, 52-year-old professor of communications and Romantic Poetry at Cape Technical University. Lurie believes he has created a comfortable, if somewhat passionless, life for himself. He lives within his financial and emotional means. Though his position at the university has been reduced, he teaches his classes dutifully; and while age has diminished his attractiveness, weekly visits to a prostitute satisfy his sexual needs. He considers himself happy. But when Lurie seduces one of his students, he sets in motion a chain of events that will shatter his complacency and leave him utterly disgraced. Lurie pursues his relationship with the young Melanie\u2014whom he describes as having hips \u201cas slim as a twelve-year-old\u2019s\u201d\u2014obsessively and narcissistically, ignoring, on one occasion, her wish not to have sex. When Melanie and her father lodge a complaint against him, Lurie is brought before an academic committee where he admits he is guilty of all the charges but refuses to express any repentance for his acts. In the furor of the scandal, jeered at by students, threatened by Melanie\u2019s boyfriend, ridiculed by his ex-wife, Lurie is forced to resign and flees Cape Town for his daughter Lucy\u2019s smallholding in the country. There he struggles to rekindle his relationship with Lucy and to understand the changing relations of blacks and whites in the new South Africa. But when three black strangers appear at their house asking to make a phone call, a harrowing afternoon of violence follows which leaves both of them badly shaken and further estranged from one another. After a brief return to Cape Town, where Lurie discovers his home has also been vandalized, he decides to stay on with his daughter, who is pregnant with the child of one of her attackers. Now thoroughly humiliated, Lurie devotes himself to volunteering at the animal clinic, where he helps put down diseased and unwanted dogs. It is here, Coetzee seems to suggest, that Lurie gains a redeeming sense of compassion absent from his life up to this point. Written with the austere clarity that has made J. M. Coetzee the winner of two Booker Prizes, Disgrace explores the downfall of one man and dramatizes, with unforgettable, at times almost unbearable, vividness the plight of a country caught in the chaotic aftermath of centuries of racial oppression.\", \"authors\": \"['J.

It tackles the big issues: racial, sexual, and violence (against both humans &amp; animals). It also takes a serious look at the consequences and aftermath of apartheid.\"}"}]}

There's hope of becoming friends with her stepbrother and sister, until Nore realizes they're hiding something.

While she was away her father re-married (why wouldn't a father invite his only daughter to his wedding?)and Nore is going to spend the summer with her father and his new family in an old Louisiana estate. Her new stepmother, Lisette Berge appears very beautiful but very stern, demanding of privacy and wanting to live in the estate isolated with no phone service. She has a teenage son Gabe about Nore's age and a daughter Josie of about 13.Immediately their behavior is very strange. Such as Lisette's reaction to an old woman that knew a Lisette Berge 20 years earlier and that looked exactly the same. Lisette claims it was her mother and runs off away from the woman.Then Josie and Gabe start talking about things that happened to them many years earlier, which would have been impossible considering they are only teenagers. Additionally, Josie starts talking about never physically changing and about not getting too close to anyone because they die and leave you and that this has happened to her many times. Then she talks about a brother who died many years ago but Nore finds a family photo with the brother in it and Lisette, Gabe, and Nore look exactly the same. Additionally, there is an old man in the photo who looks exactly like a portrait that was painted about 60 years earlier that is hanging in the house!Also, Nore keeps over hearing Lisette talking about a pact she has made and Josie and Gabe are upset that they weren't asked about it first. The author keeps pointing out that many of the Cajuns are into witchcraft and voodoo so the reader can get a clue as to what the pact was about.Things come to a head when Gabe tries to first cause a car accident and then tries to drown Nore in the river.It all builds up to a big climax that Ms. Duncan is very good at.

The Gunther books are straightforward police procedurals with a strong supporting cast; Joe a very likeable protagonist. When a domestic dispute turns deadly, our hero finds himself dealing with a 32-year old cold case when the current weapon is traced back to a robbery/murder Joe didn't solve early in his career. This trip down memory lane is a painful one for our hero as the original case coincided with the death of his wife - a topic alluded to in earlier volumes, but which is now front and center in The Surrogate Thief - as is Joe - the books immediately preceding this one in the series focusing on Joe's \"partners\".As is to be expected from this author/series, the cases and sleuthing are top notch, and the reader learns a little more about Joe and what makes him \"tick\"- not only his past and the loss of his wife - but also his current personal/romantic situation. While piecing together the current-day crime puzzle and resolving past issues/crimes, his current \"lady-friend\" - a recurring character we readers have come to know very well - is running for public office, upsetting Joe's, if not tranquil, very comfortable current day to day existence.For the most part these multiple threads of the story line are balanced very well. My only complaint is that at times Joe's need - his obsession - to solve the \"old\" case comes across as a bit heavy-handed; the author inserting himself frequently explaining Joe's motivation. We know Joe well enough by this point, and what drives him.Otherwise The Surrogate Thief is a very good addition to a very good series..\"}"}]}

Yet, surprisingly not only all made very understandable but then clarity and inspiration and feel good factor was never made so good in a book on a composer, also made so enjoyable. A true and real learning journey in this book.Priceless. I felt myself on tour with the writer and the works and mind of life of Beethoven as though the man was his art and his work. Out of MUCH self taught reading on classical music. This book truly remains my ALL TIME FAVOURITE book about any single composer. Supremely well written and written with clarity and passages I underlined endlessly. It is one of those books. Just well researched, well written and written about from angles and insights that you really DID want to know and not written anywhere else and never realised you did want to know and it is a real journey. If you feel a journey with Beethoven`s music this is the best book ever written to get into his mind , and his art and the music and his life as one.... A real cherished classic. I hate the phrase. This book is one of 20-30 that I look back really does come under the heading \"life changer\" and can give a truer real insight into the mind of genius and ART in capital letters and an artist`s intention and the working of a mind and spirit..and it explains the music so well in relation to his life and genius. A seriously great gem , where every page is a page turning inspiration and delight. Seriously 5+ Not a normal book. Exceedingly well done... This book is special. Class of it`s own and essential reading on Beethoven. Trust me. And write your own review. I challenge anyone not to adore this book and give it a 5 having read it. I`m serious. Think about it compared to all the others on Beethoven and dull ill written biographies and over detailed stuff. This book really hits the spot and is very very well writen in style and content and theme and insight....and is concise. : ) I.e not only readable but also exciting and a a book to learn from not just factually but with real thinking and a journey and highly enjoyable read. The world it takes one too to the mind of the composer and the music and the journey it takes one too is first class. A really enjoyable mind expanding insight. Seriously good. i.e Great.\"}"}]}

One gets the sense that Stone wished to oblige him; \"They Also Ran\", which tells the story of twenty defeated presidential candidates (from 1824 to 1948), is Stone's own effort to create an American counterpart for the great Roman biographer/judge. While the end result is certainly entertaining, it falls far short of reaching its goal.For one thing, Plutarch's historiographical and biographical style was firmly entrenched in the Roman tradition of his contemporaries, men like Suetonius and Tacitus who transcribed events not for the purpose of educating or even entertaining their readers, but rather instructing them as to the proper way of judging powerful people from the past. What's more, Plutarch organized his book on the basis of abstract themes (eloquence, honor, etc.) rather than according to any empirical historical criteria. The end result is highly entertaining and, due to Plutarch's great gifts as a historian, surprisingly detailed and informative. Such a balancing act is hard to pull off, and one must applaud Plutarch for succeeding so brilliantly.Yet Stone is no Plutarch, and his effort to replicate Plutarch's feat is often just as unsettling as it is enlightening. Men like Henry Clay and William Jennings Bryan are condemned with a passion almost frightening in its intensity, while other characters like Lewis Cass and Alton Parker are praised with equal fervor. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Stone's opinions is in many ways besides the point, however; far too often his biases actually impair his abilities as a historian, such as in his refusal to acknowledge the fact that points-of-view exist which differ from his own (most historians, for example, do not share his harsh verdict on Clay), and the often glaring omissions and errors he makes in order to buttress his claims (such as ignoring Bryan's pacifist motivations for resigning as Secretary of State in 1915, and instead lamely claiming that this was primarily due to incompetence as a way of further condemning his character). Equally unsuccessful are Stone's attempts to link thematically link together candidates from different periods of history, as he often goes to great lengths to draw connections between two or three very different men on the most tenuous of grounds (such as Greeley and Cox both being newspaper editors) while failing to successfully dig deeper into the ideological, personal, and other transcendental qualities that truly might have linked men from disparate periods of history.To be fair, these problems aren't entirely Stone's fault. The standards for historiography and biography have changed drastically since Plutarch picked up a pen two millenia ago, which wouldn't work in the favor of anyone who attempted to impersonate such a style. And despite this setback, some of his biographies actually work - his chapters on Alfred E. Smith and Wendell Willkie, for example, are superb. And I could not in all justice claim that Stone's book isn't entertaining - the man holds an able pen, and his book is a gripping page-turner in ways that one wouldn't expect for such a text. If only Stone had been just a tad more objective, this would be a perfect primer for someone who wishes to learn more about American presidential history. As it stands, his work can be viewed as a great way to enjoyable pass the time, so long as his readers take what he writes with several shakers of salt.\"}"}]}

Perry's men and women can be frustrating but she not only delves into the day to day lives of the Victorians in an accurate, detailed manner, she also writes a mystery that is NOT predictable. Perry specializes in the seedier side of the habits of the era. Don't expect to figure out what will happen, plan on being surprised unless you have read Perry's other Inspector Pitt series. In this novel a nurse has been found strangled. Hester Latterly is once again involved, a Crimean war nurse. The detail of the horrors of war experienced by early English nurses under Florence Nightingale is very well done. The battles between Hester and Monk are frustrating but enjoyable.

Discover the brave new world of Aldous Huxley's classic novel, written in 1932, which prophesied a society which expects maximum pleasure and accepts complete surveillance - no matter what the cost. 'A masterpiece of speculation... As vibrant, fresh, and somehow shocking as it was when I first read it' Margaret Atwood, bestselling author of The Handmaid's Tale 'A grave warning... Provoking, stimulating, shocking and dazzling' Observer **One of the BBC's 100 Novels That Shaped Our World**\", \"authors\": \"['Aldous Huxley']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House\", \"text\" : \"The best part of this book is the frightening utopian world that Aldous Huxley creates. The horrifying outcome of the abuse of technology, particularly genetic and reproductive manipulation, is made clear. The beginning is very detailed in providing an elaborate explanation of the automated world without family in which the book takes place. However, the characters and plot seem flat and even ridiculous in their simplicity and cultural and social stereotyping. Despite those limitations, I would recommend reading it as part of a basic education of utopian literature.\"}"}]}

The novel earned its author the distinction of being \u2018the first historian of the private consciousness\u2019. Jane Eyre, an orphan, living with her cruel aunt is punished for bullying her cousin and imprisoned in a \u2018red room\u2019. This is the same room where Jane\u2019s uncle had died. Locked in, a young Jane is haunted by her uncle\u2019s screams. Memories of an oppressive upbringing follow her like a shadow even at Lowood Charity School where she finds herself at the mercy of an abusive headmaster. As a governess at Thornfield Hall, Jane falls in love with her mysterious Byronic employer, Edward Rochester. Soon, she discovers a bitter truth about him and his \u2018mad\u2019 wife Bertha Mason. After a series of crests and troughs when Jane is ready to embark on yet another unpredictable journey, she is compelled to return to the man she had once abandoned.\", \"authors\": \"['Charlote Bront\u00eb']\", \"publisher\" : \"Om Books International\", \"text\" : \"The book Jane Eyre was only okay. In the beginning it was very hard to get in to. Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me.\"}"}]}

The climax of a campaign that began two months before in northern Mississippi, Perryville came to be recognized as the high water mark of the western Confederacy. Some said the hard-fought battle, forever remembered by participants for its sheer savagery and for their commanders\u2019 confusion, was the worst battle of the war, losing the last chance to bring the Commonwealth into the Confederacy and leaving Kentucky firmly under Federal control. Although Gen. Braxton Bragg\u2019s Confederates won the day, Bragg soon retreated in the face of Gen. Don Carlos Buell\u2019s overwhelming numbers. Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle is the definitive account of this important conflict.

The discussion of Bragg is fair and balanced; the mild psychoanaysis was helpful and insightful.I particularly enjoyed reading about the pre-battle conflicts between the Union troops and their search for food and water from private lands enroute to Perryville -- and the occasional sheltering of escaped slaves -- contrasted with some officers intent to stop the \"pilaging\" and return \"property\" to slave-owners. More than one example of men in the ranks promising to kill their own officers in the next battle is given. Not to mention the murder of General \"Bull\" Nelson by Union general Jefferson C. Davis.

It's all so simple. &quot;A savage journey to the heart of the American Dream.&quot; Right there on the cover. This book's brilliance does lay in its comedic delivery, as well as the no-holds-barred presentation of its surface subject matter, but the true, and often unappreciated, brilliance of the work is its examination of the deterioration of purpose which occured in the years following the massacre at Altamont, widely regarded as the death knell to the hippie movement. Sex, drugs and rock 'n roll had been the motto throughout the sixties. A life lived in reckless abandon, the attaining of Townshend's famous seven words. But such voracity, such avarice for experience was coupled with a purpose, a grand intention. Artists like Dylan provided hippies with a soundtrack and a belief system based in world peace and youth enlightenment. Suddenly, like a lock closing on a prison ward, Altamont hit, with four deaths, and then in 1970 the break up of the Beatles and the deaths of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. The hippie idealism, the sense of purpose was lost, What remained was the sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. Thompson magnificently examines how this loss of purpose cheapened the drug experience, and the youth experience as a whole. The tale, while hilarious, is truly somewhat sad, reeking of insecurity and inaction. The journey is savage, and the American Dream discovered is not that of oppertunity and new horizons, but that of encouraged ignorance and self-induced dementia. Enlightening as all get out.\"}"}]}

Berlin, 1945. Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has managed to wangle one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the American occupation of postwar Berlin. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles on a murder--an American soldier washed up on the shore of the conference grounds--he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What he finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation and a city not only physically but morally devastatated, where children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and the black market is the only means of survival. Berlin at zero hour is like nowhere else--a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. And nothing is simple--not the murder of a soldier and not any of the lives, American and German, that Jake encounters as he tries to solve it. More unsolvable still is the larger crime that hangs over everything in 1945, a crime so huge it seems beyond punishment.

Death comes easy to no one...especially to those who are left behind. In 1999, I lost my husband to cancer. I was 47 at the time, and it took awhile to sort through my emotions and gather the strength to face daily living again. A year and a half into widowhood, I realized how alone I felt going through all those first experiences: taking off my wedding rings, figuring out which side of the bed to sleep on, and getting through our anniversary. I then launched a Web site that generated feedback from other widows and widowers - so they could share their stories and experiences with grief and loss. The response was overwhelming. From Singapore to England to South Australia, I gathered and organized my Web site's library of material into a book that pays tribute to the millions of people who lose a partner and have to reinvent their lives and try to move forward. The After Journey is a collection of people's thoughts and words of wisdom based on their experiences after suffering a great loss in their lives. Each section begins with my own story and leads into the reflections of others on the same topic, some of those voices drawing tears from readers, while others conjuring sheer laughter and a sense of relief.

The archaeological record contains hundreds of situations in which societies developed long-term sustainable relationships with their environments\u2014and thousands in which the relationships were destructive. Charles Redman demonstrates that much can be learned from an improved understanding of peoples who, through seemingly rational decisions, degraded their environments and threatened their own survival. By discussing archaeological case studies from around the world\u2014from the deforestation of the Mayan lowlands to soil erosion in ancient Greece to the almost total depletion of resources on Easter Island\u2014Redman reveals the long-range coevolution of culture and environment and clearly shows the impact that ancient peoples had on their world. These case studies focus on four themes: habitat transformation and animal extinctions, agricultural practices, urban growth, and the forces that accompany complex society. They show that humankind's commitment to agriculture has had cultural consequences that have conditioned our perception of the environment and reveal that societies before European contact did not necessarily live the utopian existences that have been popularly supposed. Whereas most books on this topic tend to treat human societies as mere reactors to environmental stimuli, Redman's volume shows them to be active participants in complex and evolving ecological relationships. Human Impact on Ancient Environments demonstrates how archaeological research can provide unique insights into the nature of human stewardship of the Earth and can permanently alter the way we think about humans and the environment.\", \"authors\": \"['Charles L.

Guess again! Hundreds developed sustainable relationships...but thousands were horribly destructive. &quot;Humans have had a role in transforming virtually every environment and locale on this earth&quot;-(fact) no matter which continent they inhabited.

I applied the approach as follows: (1) read only those assignments provided by the professor (ignore commercial outlines, etc.); (2) take extensive notes of everything the professor says in class (and do not write down any student comments or student answers to Socratic questions); (3) organize your notes of the professor's lectures into your own outline; (4) read the professor's prior exam files, including any student answers selected by the professor as \"model answers\"; and (5) practice taking the professor's old exams in the few days leading up to exam day. The rationale is that your professor will be looking for you to spot those issues that he or she views as important. The more of these issues you spot, the higher your exam grade will be. Ditch those commercial outlines and study group meetings. In addition to Getting to Maybe, you should also prepare for law school by conditioning yourself to what its competition will feel like. Two excellent books that accomplish this goal are Scott Turow's One L (Harvard in the 1970s) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002 book about competition at The University of Chicago Law School).\"}"}]}

The Masterpiece Theater version stars Bryan Brown as Joe Harmon and Helen Morse as Jean Paget, with Gordon Jackson as Noel Strachen--a completely new and romantic turn for the actor I will always think of as Hudson-The-Butler.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \"an enormous thing,\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times\u2014rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length\u2014we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.\", \"authors\": \"['Jules Verne']\", \"publisher\" : \"Library of Alexandria\", \"text\" : \"Jules Vernes captures our imaginations in his tale of adventure and science. The narrator, Dr. Arronax, is a French naturalist who goes on an expedition to hunt down a mysterious sea creature spotted by many sailors. However, in an interesting turn of events, he finds out that the enigma that roamed the oceans is in fact a futuristic submarine (the Nautilus) built by Captain Nemo. Dr. Annonax, along with his Flemish companion Conseil and Canadian harpooner Ned Land, are held hostage on the Nautilus and through their time aboard they experience the great wonders of the seas. Giant squids, ice caps, pearl hunts, close calls with Papuan natives, are only a fraction of the exciting events they experience.Using Arronax as the narrator, Verne gives us a look into the mysteries of the deep seas. While Arronax often gets carried away labeling and categorizing sea life, it makes the narrative seem more authentic. I felt a little cheated about not learning the life story of the brilliant and enigmatic Captain Nemo. We learn that he is driven by revenge, yet we don't know exactly why and who is his unfortunate target. However, this lack of revelation allows the reader to create his/her own theories, which can be quite fun.This book may not be for action junkies, as shown by previous reviews. However, I recommend this book to readers who are curious about the unknown with an interest in science. It is an interesting and very creative read, and should not be missed!\"}"}]}

Focusing on a castle called Chepstow on the border between England and Wales, acclaimed Medievalists Joseph and Frances Gies offer an exquisite portrait of what day-to-day life was actually like during the era, and of the key role the castle played. The Gieses write eloquently about the many people whose lives revolved around the castle, from the lord and lady to the commoners of the surrounding village. We discover what lords and serfs alike would have worn, eaten, and done for leisure; the songs sung; and the codes of sexual conduct that maintained order. We learn of the essential role of honor in medieval culture, the initiation process undertaken by knights, and how castles attempted to keep the constant threats of outside violence at bay.

Reynolds, the Bancroft Prize-winning author of Walt Whitman\u2019s America. Casting fresh light on Andrew Jackson, who redefined the presidency, along with John Quincy Adams and James K. Polk, who expanded the nation\u2019s territory and strengthened its position internationally, Reynolds captures the turbulence of a democracy caught in the throes of the controversy over slavery, the rise of capitalism, and the birth of urbanization.\", \"authors\": \"['David S. Reynolds']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harper Collins\", \"text\" : \"This book is a classic of American History, and is very much a chapter in Schlesinger's broader project of discovering the roots of (then-) modern liberalism through history. This is a book that is best described as a history of ideas, and particularly of the idea of democracy as it expanded in the 1830s and 1840s, embracing universal suffrage and economic as well as political egalitarianism. The book very much reflects the time in which it was written and the debates which it was part of, and, like much history of the period, seeks to refocus discussion of American history away from themes of frontier and nationalialism.There are several things this book is not:This book is not a comprehensive history of the period;it is not even a social or economic history of the period;it is not a biography of Jackson (indeed, Martin Van Buren may well receive more ink than Jackson in this book); andit is not an attempt to write a definitive work; rather, it is a voice in a rather lively debate.Schlesigner's voice in the book is clear and open. His own biases and prejudices are on the surface, not hidden and not given any claims of a \"disinterested\" scientific approach. Yet his research and his mustering of support are thorough and meticulous, and he is just as clear in discussing the shortcomings of his analysis (such as in the closing chapters) as in describing the shortcoming of other's analyses.His fundamental argument is that the Jacksonian intellectual tradition was the first American intellectual tradition to clearly recognize a need for economic as well as political egalitarianism, and the first to make good on the fundamental concept that \"All men (still men in the Jacksonian age) are created equal.\" He focuses on the entire intellectual movement of Jacksonian Democracy, not exclusively on the General himself, and shows the differing currents of thought and how they interacted to create a policy that fundamentally based itself on addressing a conflict between classes.Schlesinger's project does have difficulty in dealing with reactions to slavery, which cut across class and ideological lines, and he wrestles through this to recognize in the end that a fundamental conflict of the time was the conflict between a sectionally and ideologically motiviated politics, resulting in much \"crossing of aisles\" and in radically different alliances in the 50s and 60s than existed in the 30s and 40s. Perhaps, however, it is just as important to examine ideologies that go beyond the Jacksonian economic perspectives and focus on underlying religious and moral views. Schlesigner also wrestles briefly, and less successfully still, with the impact of immigration and the opening of the frontier on the development of American political ideas. In doing so, at the end of the book, however, he is more laying out the areas needing further work than attempting to actually tackle the issues in detail.Some of the many strenghts: Schlesigner provides us with the most coherant discussion before or since of the failure and demise of federalism, gives us the best history before or since on the battles over the 2nd National Bank, and brings out significant parts of the Jacksonian inheritance that had long been underappreciated. He incorporates original material into his work in a way that animates the material, makes it clearly understandable, and provides it context. Perhaps most importantly of all, he contributes a voice to American history that is personal and open, and puts the biases and personal intellectual struggles of the writer on display as part and parcel of his analysis.Since Schlesinger's time, much has changed, but, in the developing debates Jacksonian Democracy is perhaps even more relevant. For example, there is again an alliance between economic and religious conservatives as there was in the Harrison/Van Buren election. Other reviewers have criticized, for example, Schlesigner's finding of common cause with the radical Jacksonians given Schlesinger's prediliction for \"big government\" liberalism; yet Schlesinger is very clear and insightful in showing how that the Jacksonian opposition's early view of limited government was inspired by the clear alliance of government and business at the time to the detriment of the common person, and that the view of government involvement developed significantly as the Jacksonians consolidated power and then watched it dissipate. We are once again in an era where the conservative party is increasingly the party of a bigger, more expansive and intrusive government, one which actively promotes policies geared toward conservative causes and business interests, and where liberals are, once again, more often the voice of governmental restraint. Schlesinger's analysis is helpful in tying together the development of differing approaches to government all in a common attempt to serve and respond to egalitarian social concerns. Schlesigner also is careful to call out the discontinuities between Jacksonian Democracy and the New Deal, highlighting in particular the struggles of the Jacksonians with industrialization, immigration and slavery.While this book is highly recommended for all, and, indeed, is among the very best American History works, it is particularly recommended for those seeking intellectual roots for egalitarianism.\"}"}]}

While most of Kenyon's Hunter Legends stories so far have involved the ass-kicking Dark-Hunters, NIGHT PLAY shifts the focus to the equally yummy Were-Hunters.The Were-Hunters are actually two separate and distinct species created by an ancient sorcerer king determined to save his two sons from dying of the Apollite curse on their twenty-seventh birthdays. Splicing the essence of powerful animals such as bears, wolves, and even dragons with that of the Apollites, the Arcadians and Katagaria were born. While the Katagaria had the hearts of the animal and the Arcadians that of humans, they were two halves of a whole and should have lived together in harmony, far stronger and with a life expectancy much longer than any race before. However, the gods were displeased and wanted them destroyed. When the king refused, the gods decreed the two species would never know peace and planted mistrust between them. Soon, suspicion between Arcadians and Katagaria turned into hate, and hatred into open war. A war that continues to this day...as Vane Kattalakis knows only too well.Born from the forced mating by his Katagari father on his Arcadian mother, hybrid Were-Hunter Vane Kattalakis has spent a lifetime being rejected and feared by everyone except his brother, Fang, and sister, Anya. But when Daemons attack his wolf pack and kill Anya in retaliation for Vane helping the Dark-Hunters, the two brothers are sentenced to death by their own father. Barely escaping with a grievously wounded Fang, Vane lays low at Sanctuary in New Orleans, waiting for his brother to recover and knowing it's just a matter of time before assassins come for them. The last thing Vane expects is to find his destined mate, a human female at that.Was it because she'd just been dumped by her boyfriend via FedEx? Perhaps it was a case of temporary insanity? Whatever the cause, when the most gorgeous man she's ever seen walks into her store, buys her favorite necklace, and presents it to her as a present, shopkeeper Bride McTierney throws caution to the wind and has an unforgettable afternoon tryst with the mysterious Vane Kattalakis. Convinced it was just a fling, Bride's life takes a detour into the Twilight Zone when she suddenly acquires a new pet wolf, and Vane returns determined to woo her. Is he for real?With a three-week deadline to make Bride his mate or else live the rest of her lifetime in celibacy -- so NOT an option -- Vane must win the girl, confess he's her new pet wolf, and, oh by the way, there's a death warrant out for his hide. That's nothing this wolf can't handle, expect for one tiny problem. Practical Bride doesn't believe in the supernatural. Yep, love bites.Once again, Sherrilyn Kenyon adds another intriguing layer to her popular series. Brimming with ancient cultural nuances and spiked with classic Shakespearean pathos, NIGHT PLAY is nevertheless a very modern tale packed with Kenyon's highly irreverent humor. Vane and Bride are a fun pair. He's a little bit hairy; she's a little bit paranoid. Actually, you'd worry too if you weren't sure what kind of offspring you'd produce. Vane's family squabbles redefine the word \"dysfunctional,\" while the Dark-Hunters provide some of the best comic moments with their \"dating tips\" for the clueless Were-Hunter.Hot, sexy, and fun, NIGHT PLAY is just the perfect summer read to sink your teeth (or fangs) into.

On the other other hand, when Heinlein steps out and tries his hand at something truly unorthodox (like a stargate), his work holds up very well. Here, Heinlein uses the concept of the stargate to pretty much tell a version of 'Lord of the Flies'.The main character, Rod Walker, is dumped onto an alien planet with around 100 others. Each of them are sent out alone, with whatever they feel they need to survive 4-10 days, from knives and flints to state of the art blasters and power packs. As time goes on Rod finds that either he has missed the rendezvous or no one seems to be coming. And the story shifts focus to a long term survival on this alien world.Heinlein has a great gift for suspenseful writing. This is one that should keep you enjoying it from start to finish.\"}"}]}

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap. \u201cSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,\u201d comments Jim Collins, \"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.\u201d Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\", \"authors\": \"['Jim Collins']\", \"publisher\" : \"HarperBusiness\", \"text\" : \"I received this book in less than one week and it was in great condition.\"}"}]}

They developed a deep friendship, but Aaron's life became hopelessly confused, perhaps acting as a double agent, throwing in his lot with the police (although the ineptitude suggests he was really trying to disrupt their pursuit), estranged from the community of Kelly sympathisers.

Berg describes her parents\u2019 marriage as a romance that lasted for nearly seventy years; she grew up watching her father kiss her mother upon leaving home, and kiss her again the instant he came back. His idea of when he should spend time away from her was never. But then Berg\u2019s father developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and her parents were forced to leave the home they loved and move into a facility that could offer them help.

She wants to let go and start life anew, but her child whom she killed, the tree-like scars on her back, stories of from Paul D and Stamp all return to haunt her. Not many will be able to rationalize Sethe's intention behind murdering her children. However, considering the setting of the scene with \"four horsemen\", reminiscent of the biblical Apocalypse, we are actually more inclined to empathize with Sethe.The inhumane treatment of the black slaves described so vividly reminds us of the atrocities of slavery. \"Beloved\" also seeks to illustrate the theme of love - mother-daughter love, sisterly love, heterosexual love and brotherhood love among the blacks. The book's allusion to a ghost wreaking havoc in the house is only an excuse for the unfolding of the plot.\"Beloved\" is a book that scores on the depth of the issues covered, the marvel of its storytelling and the soundness of characterization.

Not in the airport per se... on the tarmac, still 8th in line for take-off, actually, leaving me wanting more for the hour and twenty minutes we were in the air.I loved it. Unlike some books with multiple story lines, no one story over another held my interest more. I was equally engaged in all. That balance is very delicate and was surely thought out to the nth degree in the editing process.The characters were the heart of the story, way above the plot. They were lifelike, real, human, etc. These could have been members of my own family, had I come from the Plains.Those quiet and beautiful McPheron brothers were at the core of the story. I would have loved an entire novel just about them, but then I would have missed out on other gems like Tom, burnt but not quite broken, and Maggie, who, as Haruf describes her (I'll have to look this up), \"(doesn't) get defeated or scared by life.\" I could have used a lot more information about the two boys and Tom's ultimate retribution against the Beckmans, but I think that's just my reaction to the injustice they suffered.My only criticism was the editing choice behind the lack of quotation marks. Maybe I'm just a purist when it comes to that sort of thing, but I believe you need a really good reason for such a break in traditional punctuation standards. Like, maybe if you're writing from the first person point of view and you want all of the prose to merge together, dialog and narration, to indicate that the speaker isn't really distinguishing himself, in his own mind. Here, though, it was a distraction to me, at least at first.I know some writers choose to do things like that just to be different. Charles Frazier, in Cold Mountain, for instance, preceded each sparse line of dialog with a dash, instead of wrapping it in quotes. I struggled with that as well. Then again, Frazier won the National Book Award and Haruf was nominated, so maybe those who judge like the breaks from tradition. Who knows?I just prefer my narration and dialog to be clearly delineated. Plus, when you do something like that, you need to be extra careful with your commas, since that's all that separates the speech from the speaker, and I found three or four comma splices as I was reading along which threw me off track.Regardless of that very minor complaint, the writing was excellent and the characters were the best I've come across since The Shipping News, which is still on the top of my list of personal favorites.\"}"}]}

Thanks to cartoons and folk accounts we have a distorted view of these other humans - for that is what they were. We think of them as crude and clumsy and not very bright, easily driven to extinction by the lithe, smart modern humans that came out of Africa some 100,000 years ago. But was it really as simple as that? Clive Finlayson reminds us that the Neanderthals were another kind of human, and their culture was not so very different from that of our own ancestors. In this book, he presents a wider view of the events that led to the migration of the moderns into Europe, what might have happened during the contact of the two populations, and what finally drove the Neanderthals to extinction. It is a view that considers climate, ecology, and migrations of populations, as well as culture and interaction. His conclusion is that the destiny of the Neanderthals and the Moderns was sealed by ecological factors and contingencies. It was a matter of luck that we survived and spread while the Neanderthals dwindled and perished. Had the climate not changed in our favour some 50 million years ago, things would have been very different. There is much current research interest in Neanderthals, much of it driven by attempts to map some of their DNA. But it's not just a question of studying the DNA. The rise and fall of populations is profoundly moulded by the larger scale forces of climate and ecology. And it is only by taking this wider view that we can fully understand the course of events that led to our survival and their demise. The fact that Neanderthals survived until virtually yesterday makes our relationship with them and their tragedy even more poignant. They almost made it, after all.\", \"authors\": \"['Clive Finlayson']\", \"publisher\" : \"OUP Oxford\", \"text\" : \"Before Steve Alten's book Meg, there was Wilson's Extinct.

Earth's center is fiery molten iron/nickel core, not a prehistoric underworld. But James Verne was probably not aware of this discomfiting fact when he penned his classic science expedition adventure \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (hereafter, JCE). It's inconsequential, because Verne went ahead and captured the true essence of how an expedition begins, how it is prepared for and equipped, and what data the expedition records. Verne also illuminates the vivid but widely diverse personalities of the three men who embark on this stunning trek, the obsessed leader of the trip Professor Hardwigg, his unwilling but scientifically competent nephew Harry, and the industrious, phlegmatic, dependable Hans (but no duck, Gertrude or otherwise).Professor Hardwigg's discovery of a parchment by the late Arne Saknusseum (hereafter A.S.) launches the tale. \"A.S.\" is widely believed to be the first person to reach Earth's center and return alive. Hardwigg eagerly believes the parchment is a road map to the center and attempts to decipher it, without success. On the other hand, Harry's last thing on his mind is a mad, dangerous subterranean trip; he is more interested in marrying his fiancee and enjoying his bourgeois comforts. The manic Hardwigg will have none of it; he insanely vows that he (and Harry) will not eat until the parchment is deciphered. Abstinence and hunger are not among Harry's pastimes, as he describes an ordeal he suffered as a little boy, when he accidentally got stuck in a chimney while trying to remove a bird's nest, and waited for hours for rescue. In a bit of foreshadowing Harry absorbingly describes the hallucinatory toll his hunger took on him, until the chimney masonry his belt is stuck on crumbled and he tumbled to safety. At length, Harry stumbles upon the parchment code; it is not in a non-German, foreign language, but simply in cunning backwards German! Alarmed, Harry attempts to keep Hardwigg from learning the answer, too, but his fast and his compassion for his uncle's mental anguish force him to divulge the secret. To Harry's further alarm, Hardwigg resolves to follow the map and A.S.'s clues (and initials) to Earth's center.However, even the impulsive Hardwigg realizes that he needs careful preparation for the trip. First, in a fairly comic chapter, he compels Harry to overcome his acrophobia (fear of heights) by climbing to the top of their town's church spire repeatedly. After all, a lot of climbing and rapelling will be involved. Next, off they go to Iceland by boat (where Hardwigg, to his irritated embarassment, suffers seasickness). Mount Sneffels, an extinct volcano A.S.'s parchment describes as the doorway to Earth's core, is located there. However, before the ascent and descent, Hardwigg secures the services of the brawny, laconic, and reliable worker and porter Hans. Hans is a workhorse, provided he gets his weekly 3 Icelandic rix-dollars. The trio lay in their supplies: food, climbing gear, bedding, and chronometer (which will measure the depth and distance from Sneffels of their descent. Verne devotes a chapter each to the ascent and descent of Sneffels. Then the expedition begins.As I said, Verne realistically captures the obstacles and obstructions of a scientific expedition, from cave claustrophobia, to rock-slides, to wrong directions, and especially the want of water, which really affects Harry. Although he may seem querulous and whiny to his uncle and to us, Harry is actually quite sensible about the necessities of an expedition. No matter how consumed Hardwigg is with his quest, the trip will fail without water. Only the discovery of internal hot springs and Han's patient release of that torrent saves the trio from thrist and incidentally releases a trickle that will lead to the core.However, as the trio follows the stream, Harry inadvertently gets separated from the group and finds himself lost with almost no food and water. Naturally, he panics and despairs. Fortunately, he is in a cavern that conducts sound well and successfully uses it to call his uncle. By deducing sound's speed through rock, Hardwigg informs the faltering, weak Harry that he is 5 MILES away from them. Nevertheless, Harry stumbles forward until he falls down a shaft and loses consciousness.Harry awakes with a head injury and tender care by his anxious uncle. To his amazement, Harry sees a beach with giant mushrooms and an ocean stretching to the horizon. Meanwhile, Hans is methodically building a raft. After Harry's convalescence, the trio set sail on the Central Sea. They endure storms, lightning, prehistoric ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs and even a magnetic ball that lands on their raft. When they finally reach land, they are stunned and disappointed to learn that the wind pushed them back to where they started! Hardwigg fumes until they find A.S.'s initials in a hole in a seaside cliff. Providence is with them.The trio spend a couple of days exploring the beach and find a treasure trove of ancient fossils. Harry and Hardwigg wax rhapsodic about their finds, especially when they discover an ancient blade that could have only belonged to Saknusseum. Even more shocking, Harry and Hardwigg discover a herd of living mastodons (elephant-like creatures) feeding on trees, and being tended by a giant caveman. At Harry's insistence, they wisely don't get any closer.Finally, the trio enter the cave in the cliff and follow A.S.'s trail until they reach an impassable boulder, which fell after Saknusseum's time. The trio decide to dynamite the boulder. Bad move. The explosion does remove the obstacle, but the seismic shock also causes the sea to pour into the new gap. The trio has barely enough time to ride the swell along the shaft. Along they go (with Harry having an amusing but horrifying dream about an \"Ape Gigans\" chasing him) until they improbably enter the shaft of a live volcano with lava about to erupt. At length, the volcano (which turns out to be Stromboli in Italy) spews out the trio. Fabricating a shipwreck tale to describe their haggard appearance, they receive aid from Italian fisherman and a voyage home to a heroes' welcome in Konigstrausse, Germany. Hans receives his proper wages from Hardwigg and returns to Iceland. Impressed by Harry's feat, his fiancee agrees to marry him. However, despite the accolades, Hardwigg is upset because the compass he brought along on the journey no longer pointed north. Harry comes to the \"rescue\" by explaining that the magnetic ball on the raft reversed the polarity. Now everyone can be happy.Again, if you can overlook the scientific inaccuracies (including the premise, the impossibility of riding hot lava, and being spewed miles away without death and injury) JCE gives you an exciting, engrossing, easy-to-follow, largely realistic scientific expedition. Through Hardwick, JCE also reminds us expedition leaders NEED to be indomitable, obsessed, and even slightly mad to be effective. Nevertheless, expeditions need to balance the Ahab-like megalomania with cautious, quietly competent, hard-working, and loyal followers (personified by Harry and Hans) to be focused and successful. And yet, I noticed a (I think) slight flaw toward JCE's end. The expedition brought NO tangible evidence that they traveled beneath the earth (of course how could they, being spit out by a volcano?). So why is the Professor and company being feted? The movie version of JCE starring James Mason as the Professor at least acknowledges that oversight by modestly stating that he doesn't deserve the celebrity because he brought no souvenirs of his trip. Oh, well, skip that too and enjoy a fantastic but mostly plausible, well-told, politics-free tale.\"}"}]}

In the novel the author causes Alexander to give us his perspective, motivations, thoughts, and doubts about the effort of the Macedonians to conquer all of the known world, including the Greeks' deadly enemy, the Persian Empire. Alexander's insights are quite interesting, and ring true, as he \"confides\" to the reader the difficulties in uniting and leading to victory a disparate army of tough, rude tribesmen some of whom hate one another almost as much as the enemy.I am a (very) amateur historian, and have never understood what happened during the time of Alexander the Great. This novel does a good job of acquainting the reader with some of the elements that went into Alexander's success. First and foremost, Alexander held nothing back. To motivate his army, he gave away essentially all of his vast royal properties and worldly goods to his soldiers, that they might leave to fight without fear of returning to poverty or want. Even so, he led his men to the point of exhaustion and mutiny. Again, he held nothing back, and apparently no effort went unexpended.Particularly interesting was the insights regarding the Greek Phalanx, and how Alexander departed from the ritualized convention that had come to dominate Greek tactics. The Greeks had become rigid and formalized in their tactics, and by departing from this structure, Alexander subdued the other Greek city-states. A cautionary lesson to all strategists of all times.The author's prose is good, and this book holds the reader's interest throughout, while imparting interesting historical insights and information. This is a novel that illustrates that actual history is often the source of the most engaging storylines.\"}"}]}

Author and counselor Joe Dallas, in a loving and biblical manner, spells out what pro-gay theology is and how to confront it, then examines the believer's personal response and the need for bold love and commitment. He also gives detailed responses to the main scriptural arguments posed by the pro-gay movement, and evaluates the movement's impact on culture and the church.\", \"authors\": \"['Joe Dallas']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harvest House Pub\", \"text\" : \"As a sibling of a homosexual who claims to be a Christian, I know first-hand how the issue of the legitimacy of homosexuality for Christians divides families, friends and churches. I have purchased and read nearly 100 books on all sides of the issue and I am also a diligent student of the Bible itself, so I feel competent to state my opinion of this book and its message. First, I am glad Dallas wrote this book, which needed to be written. At one point I wanted to write a book on this very topic, but Dallas is probably the best person for this job.Dallas rightly points to the correspondence between denigration of the authority of the Bible and the rise of \"gay Christianity\"; however, it needs to be stressed that the former is the primary cause of the latter. If 19th and 20th century Bible-believing Christians had not largely retreated into a cultural ghetto, essentially abandoning the public square to Bible-denying Liberal \"Christianity,\" \"gay Christianity\" and its other allies in the assault on orthodoxy would never have gotten off the ground. The roots of the problem are inextricably intertwined with hermeneutics, and Higher Criticism's assault on Biblical authority goes back to the 19th century. Higher Criticism and Liberalism have long been absolutely refuted but that doesn't stop men from clinging to those false beliefs. The same can be said for so-called \"gay Christianity\"; the writings of Dallas, Bahnsen, Wold, Satinover, Saia, Bergner, Davies and many others - and of course both the Hebrew and Greek scriptures - make it abundandly clear that the issue is completely settled: \"gay Christian\" is an oxymoron. That won't keep some people from clinging to their delusions in any case.One of the ironies of homosexual theology is that they can't make up their mind about whether the Bible approves or disapproves of homosexuality. On the one hand, we have people like Daniel A. Helmeniak and John J. McNeill, who assert the church has traditionally misread the Bible and that it's really all right after all (the legerdemain and contortions needed to reach that conclusion deserve to be on stage at Las Vegas). On the other hand, we have people like Gary David Comstock (\"Unrepentant, Self-Affirming, Practicing: Lesbian/Bisexual/Gay People Within Organized Religion\" and \"Gay Theology without Apology\"), who openly admit that the Bible does indeed condemn homosexuality in no uncertain terms, and therefore the Bible needs to be jettisoned completely. At least Comstock has a shred of integrity in recognizing the undeniable.Over and against both \"gay Christian\" camps, Dallas presents a surprisingly mature does of biblical reality. I say \"surprisingly\" because I wasn't expecting much from anyone connected with the MCC, but obviously Dallas' own struggles have sent him back to the Bible and given him true wisdom. He rightly goes to the root of this issue: the authority of the Bible over the life of the believer.The only way a homosexual can profess to be a Christian while also embracing his or her homosexuality is to deny the authority of biblical revelation, and to make primary the so-called \"revelation\" in their own minds and hearts. Whose word is authoritative, God's, or man's? That is what it comes down to.Are we to accept as valid a person's subjective definition of \"love\" as some warm and fuzzy feeling in our breast (or a swelling in the pants), or do we believe Jesus when He says, \"If you love Me, keep My commandments . . . He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.\"Jesus said, \"If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple . . . If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" If a homosexual wishes to follow Christ, he or she must be so committed to Christ that they are willing to make that self-denial. Anyone who cannot or will not do that is not a Christian, but merely self-deceived.Dallas has done a good service through this book. So-called \"gay Christians\" may protest about it being \"poison\" animated by \"theology of fear\" and \"careless of human experience in the realms of sociology, anthropology or psychology,\"or they may make bizarre, baseless assertions that the Bible approves of polygamy, child marriage, or other aberrations, or they may insist there is no link between homosexuality and pedophilia. (In truth the most basic underlying cause is the same: hostility to God). However, everything the so-called \"gay Christians\" say is smoke and mirrors. They are without a leg to stand on. This book points to the only solution: self-denial in embracing Jesus Christ. This is true for all people, regardless of their sexual orientation. Homosexuals are no exception.\"}"}]}

There are two places which the story revolves around. One is the hotel owned by a German named Schomberg, probably located in a port city in the Indonesian or Malaysian isles, which caters to the community of Europeans in the area working in such industries as shipping. The other place is an island located at some distance from the island where Schomberg's hotel is located and where Axel Heyst lives, apart from the presence of his Chinese man servant, a completely solitary life on the abandoned grounds of the Tropical Belt Coal Company.Heyst is a British person of Swedish descent. His father was an intellectual who wrote books expressing a deeply pessimistic philosophy about life. Influenced by his father's philosophy, Heyst has not much enthusiasm for taking part in the activities of the world. After his father dies, he is apparently left with a comfortable inheritance and leaves Britain to go on a journey of aimless wandering in Southeast Asia. While in East Timor, then a Portuguese colony, he encounters a man he vaguely knows named Morrison. Heyst saves Morrison from an incident of financial and legal distress and Morrison is very grateful. Morrison eventually badgers Heyst into investing in a burgeoning coal company that is engaged in exploration off a nearby island. In pity for Morrison and without much interest in the endeavor, Heyst invests in the Tropical Belt Coal Company. This coal company eventually goes belly-up but while the Chinese laborers and staff of the company's plantation withdrawal from the island, Heyst remains. One of the Chinese laborers, Wang, chooses to remain with Heyst as a man-servant. An indigenous tribe lives on the other side of the island but they have little interaction with Heyst. Heyst, utilizing the several years worth of provisions left by the company on the island, lives a life of virtually complete solitude. Meanwhile, Morrison gets sick, goes back to England and dies.Heyst is a kindly man but the European males that come across him regard him as weird because of his aimless wandering, his lack of enthusiasm for taking part in the affairs of the world and finally, his decision to live in solitude on the abandoned Tropical Belt company grounds. Schomberg, the hotel keeper, in particular regards Heyst with malicious scorn. Schomberg is a vicious gossip and makes up stories about Heyst, which he probably comes to believe as true. He scorns Heyst as a social freak and alleges that Heyst deliberately drove Morrison into illness and death so he, Heyst, could steal all of Morrison's wealth.Meanwhile Schomberg has his eye on one of the performers in an all female orchestra that is performing at his hotel. The players in this orchestra are treated miserably and kept as virtual hostages as they are dragged across Asia and forced to perform bad music at gathering spots for Europeans. The performers tend to be thin, worn and old-looking but the performer Schomberg is interested in is 19 years old and has a seductive physical appearance and feminine charm. Alma, the performer's name, comes from the dregs of British society but in spite of the deprivation of her upbringing, she displays a nobility of spirit. Schomberg has a wife, a weak, submissive, worn woman whom he abuses, but he lusts after Alma, stalking her about the hotel and whispering lecherous rhetoric into her ears. He is a fat older man and she thinks he is gross and frightening. Meanwhile, while Heyst is staying at Schomberg's hotel on a brief business trip, he encounters Alma, is seduced by her charm and sees that she is miserable being employed by the orchestra. Before Schomberg knows what happens, Heyst secretly takes Alma back to his deserted island, away from her slavery in the orchestra and the vulgar attempts of Schomberg to seduce her.This flight into the arms of Heyst enrages Schomberg. Schomberg is quite sure Alma would have gladly assented to become his lover if Heyst had not used his evil wiles to seduce Alma into running off with him. Overcome with violent jealousy, Schomberg has an opportunity for revenge when two British born sociopath thieves and scam artists arrive at this hotel. The two criminals, Jones and Ricardo, have spent years traveling the world together and engaging in crime. They bully and threaten Schomberg into allowing them to set up an illegal gambling operation at his hotel. In order to induce them to leave his hotel, Schomberg decides to tell Ricardo about Heyst and the prodigious amounts of money and other valuable items that Schomberg falsely alleges Heyst has stored on the island. Schomberg hopes that he will be able to use the criminals to take revenge on Heyst for stealing Alma by sending them off to track down Heyst, rob him of his alleged loot and kill him. Schomberg is successful in getting rid of the criminals by this device. The criminals eventually find Heyst's island and land on it.After the criminals land on the island and encounter Heyst, Conrad does an excellent job keeping up the suspense until the final result of the encounter between Heyst and the two criminals is revealed at the very end of the book.The best part about this book is the simplicity, clarity and engaging quality of the prose. It's hard to think of an author who has better powers of description than Conrad. The description of Schomberg, his activities and mental processes, is really excellent. Among the other scenes that are really well done, I'll mention Schomberg's altercations with the orchestra leader after Heyst runs off with Alma and Ricardo's description of how he and Jones first picked up Pedro, their mentally challenged and brutish man-servant, during an adventure off the coast of Colombia. Alma (or Lena as Heyst changes her name to) is an engaging character too though she is portrayed in excessively romantic fashion.\"}"}]}

And magic is what we get from every point of view in this book.Anthony, the teenage hockey star, is our first-person character, and through him we learn about the world his family inhabits: its geographical location as well as its emotional landscape. The joy of the story is moving from this first person to the points of view of his father, his mother, his neighbor, and a few other characters who inhabit this space. All are searching or longing for connections, deeply personal connections. In the shadow of the Meadowlands complex, where a wrong turn off Route 3 can lead to danger or just surreality, connections are hard to come by, even within the bounds of your own family.Some of the jumping around in this book makes for the most fun. From revisiting high school from the point of view of the bully's girlfriend as he beats on some sorry kid to meeting a lover on a trip to buy bagels, Reiken gets you with absolutely fascinating magic moments.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.\", \"authors\": \"['George Orwell']\", \"publisher\" : \"epubli\", \"text\" : \"\"1984\" by George Orwell is the kind of book that you only re-read because you didn't understand it the first time. While the concepts of the book are extremely intriguing, it lacks the kind of a plot line that would make it great. The lack of suspense and frequent drawn-out episodes make this book dry and very dense. The only things that got me through were the complex and extremely well thought out concepts which I couldn't stop thinking about. \"1984\" will cause you to rethink all that you know about the world you live in and make you pray that nothing like it will ever come to exist.With the single act of opening a blak diary, Winston Smith becomes an enemy of the Party, the totalitarian government led by a figure named Big Brother. \"1984\" follows Winston's fight against the oppressive government of the Party, including his search for an underground organization known as the Brotherhood and a secret love affair with another Party member. But in this world ruled by telescreens, doublethink, and the Thought Police, to oppose the Party is practically suicide. How can he know who to trust when falsification is the norm and the truth doesn't exist. Can he really expect to win against a government that has the power to rewrite the past and control human thought.I would recommend this book to people with a lot of patience. Anybody else will become frustrated before the first chapter ends on page 92. I would also recommend this book to anybody who has read \"The DiVinci Code\" or any of Dan Brown's other books. While not nearly as fast paced as \"Angels and Demons\", you will ensnared by the conceptual side of this book the same way I was. Overall, it's a good read for anybody that can handle complexity and density.\"}"}]}

This historical background information In the Heart of the Sea is helpful because it allows the reader to better understand the culture of the industry and the reasons why workers were placed in such appalling straits.The second book that is worth reading is The Custom of the Sea, which came out a few months ago. The Custom of the Sea centers on a shipwreck where three survivors killed and ate a fourth crewmember who was already dying of dehydration. In a breach from ordinary legal tradition, these survivors were tried for murder and Custom of the Sea does a very nice job of presenting the societal questions underlying the murder prosecution. In the Heart of the Sea does not explore these issues in the same depth, but both books are worth reading.\"}"}]}

Upon reading Ultra-Metabolism, I recognized information I use and share...all the time.Why read or buy another \"weight-loss\" book when the Seven Keys to the New Science of Weight Loss are listed on page 73-74? According to Dr. Hyman, everyone has his or her own instruction manual. So why purchase this book? I would suggest that you download guides from www.ultrametabolism.com. This may be enough for you. The book serves as support and offers reminders to help people keep on track.Ultra-Metabolism quizzes you and guides you, step-by-step, to deciphering your own metabolism, and a whole lot more, in what he calls an \"Ultra-Metabolism Prescription\". Again, Dr. Hyman instructs us that this is the basis for generating the right instructions to your own body, through diet, and ... Ultra-Metabolism.Dr. Hyman follows the premise of food containing information to talk to our genes, or \"Nutrigenomics\". In addition to offering exciting, cutting-edge research, he offers nutritionally-sound advice on how you can talk to your genes: Eat real, whole foods; eat foods high in phytonutrients; eat foods with a low glycemic to control appetite; eat more fiber intake to lower body fat; get your meal timing right to help turn on your metabolism; reduce stress (stress makes you fat, relaxation makes you thin); exercise in a manner that turns on metabolism; and reduce inflammation.\"Eat breakfast daily: Spread your food intake and calories throughout the day; Wait at least two to three hours after your last meal before going to sleep.\"Where have you heard this before?Another example of simple, effective suggestions are supplements to consider when you are turning on Ultra-Metabolism:\"1. A multivitamin and mineral combination. 2. A balanced, absorbable calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D supplement. 3. An omega-3 fatty acid supplement.Many people do very well with a structured approach to weight loss. As the reader would expect, Dr. Hyman guides you to natural weight loss, step-by-step. Starting with Step one: Detoxifying the liver.In addition to offering a plethora of practical, easy-to-implement weight loss suggestions, the author busts a few \"myths\" while promoting education. He includes information regarding \"Nutrition\", and how we come to think about food:P. 66 The food industry generates more than a trillion dollars in annual sales, accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. gross national product (GNP), and employees 17 percent of the country's labor force. It spends more than $33 billion a year on marketing alone. Seventy percent of those dollars go to pushing fast food, convenience foods, candy, snacks, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and desert. Only 2.2 percent of those marketing dollars are spent on advertising for fruit, vegetables, grains or beans.I also enjoyed Dr. Hyman inclusion of relevant and stimulating quotes:\"Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises.\"Samuel ButlerAs you would expect, Dr. Hyman offers the usual faire of delicious, natural recipes, and Ultra-Metabolism possesses its fair share of \"buzz-words\". Ultra-Metabolism also includes Dr. Hyman's attempt to generate an on-line Ultra-Metabolism community, which comes off as a bit far fetched. However, taking cues from various weight-watching groups, his efforts may very well bear fruit.The \"Food is Medicine\" premise of Ultra-Metabolism focuses this book as excellent \"support\" literature. Ultra-Metabolism reinforces your healthy lifestyle choices, which, in turn, support your health and wellness. Ultimately, in this \"win-win\" situation, you gain timely, user-friendly, effective resources and guidance to be well-inform about the choices you may make ... a recipe for success.I prefer to recommend natural health texts that acknowledge alternative health practices, and their long-time contributions to the health, stress reduction and wellness fields; this acknowledgement was lacking in Ultra-Metabolism. However, given the exceptional nature of this easy-to-follow, reader-oriented book, I am happy to recommend it.\"}"}]}

It's been almost fifty years since a new wave of conservative sentiment turned the tide of popular opinion against homosexuality in America. It's been almost forty years since the earthquake that split off a huge section of the California coast. It was over thirty years ago that the United States granted the new island to homosexuals to form a country of their own; the requirement that all babies born in the U.S. who test positive for the recently discovered gay gene be sent to Cali to live with their \"own kind\" keeps the population growing, and the new country has prospered. Contact between Cali and the U.S. has been limited almost exclusively to the relocation of homosexual children. When cabinet member Cara Romero is chosen to attend a conference in New York, she's excited to visit the land of her birth. She's not surprised to find how different things are in New York compared to the life she's used to back in Cali, but she never expected to fall in love on this overseas assignment. Certainly she never expected to fall in love with the daughter of the President of the United States . . .I enjoyed reading \"The Meadowlark Sings.\" I really did. Helen Ruth Schwartz has created a compelling, if improbable, vision of the future. I love fiction that introduces me to an imaginary society and allows me to get a feel for a different way of living, and \"Meadowlark\" accomplishes this very well. The plot is fast-paced and full of mystery and exciting twists. There isn't a single important character who isn't positively endearing - these are people you'll wish you could have as friends. The developing romance between Cara and Jessica is full of sensuous and tender moments.Why only two stars for a book I enjoyed? Unfortunately, the novel was fraught with so many truly regrettable flaws that I can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. For starters, the whole premise of this novel hinges upon the existence of the \"gay gene\" (which Schwartz has dubbed the \"Scarpetti gene\" after its fictitious discoverer). I don't believe sexual orientation is a choice (actually, I know for a fact that it's not). I believe it is (almost) entirely biologically determined. However, the idea that there's a single gene, or combination of genes, that makes a person gay is preposterous to anyone who understands genetics. The fact that not all identical twins share the same sexual orientation is evidence that other factors come into play. There are biological factors other than genetics that make us who we are, such as hormones and brain structure.But maybe I'm quibbling here. Maybe I'm letting my understanding of genetics and human development get in the way of a good story. More problematic to me than the oversimplification of the origins of sexual orientation in this novel was the oversimplification of sexual orientation in general. The very first sentence of the novel mentions a gay rights march, the purpose of which was \"to demand equal rights and fair treatment for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the United States.\" This is the first and last time that bisexuality is mentioned outright in the novel. It's only so much as alluded to one other time, when Cara mentions in passing that a few children have been born in Cali, some of them as a result of intercourse. In this novel, all persons born with the Scarpetti gene are exclusively homosexual, and all persons born without it are exclusively heterosexual. There is no other option: no bisexuality, no asexuality, no pansexuality (in fact, the gender binary is utterly unquestioned), no crucial factors other than gender that contribute to attraction or arousal. Cara asks at one point whether it's possible for Jessica to be in love with her and yet not have the Scarpetti gene; the answer is an unequivocal no. Never mind that in the real world, sexual orientation is much more fluid. Having a \"girl crush\" is almost a rite of passage for young heterosexual women. I know I had a few! I've even engaged in some same-sex experimentation, as have many heterosexuals. On the other side, MOST of the homosexuals I've known have had some opposite-sex experience. People tend to experience some degree of sexual response to sexual situations, including those involving the \"wrong\" gender, a fact to which my existence, and the existence of other children of gay or lesbian parents, testifies as living proof.I know this novel was written with a gay audience in mind, but I couldn't help feeling that Schwartz really wasn't quite fair to heterosexuals. Surely there are a few of us who are artistic and creative - we'd miss our fabulous gay fashion designers if they were all exiled, but I don't think we're so hopeless on our own that we'd end up as frumpily dressed as the Americans in this novel. Furthermore, it's simply unfeasible that ANY group of people could take over an island full of rubble and within thirty years, despite minimal association with outsiders, establish a vital, thriving culture as advanced as any on earth. What really disturbed me, though, was the idea that heterosexual Americans would have gone along with all of this in the first place. It's clear Schwartz doesn't hate heterosexuals as a group, as there are a number of delightful and sympathetic characters in this novel who happen to be straight - but the premise just doesn't work. Some of the most ardent supporters of GLBT interests I know are 100% straight, but unwilling to see ANYONE deprived of civil rights. Where were they when the exile to Cali was going on? No matter how powerful the right-wing religious groups got to be, surely more than a few people would have stood up and protested the exile of their parents, children, siblings, and friends to an island, with any sort of travel or communication between the countries (except for government business) strictly forbidden. And with seven thousand children being sent to Cali every WEEK, is it reasonable to assume so many bereft mothers and fathers would simply accept the status quo?These flaws are so integral to the concept of this novel that I'm not entirely sure how it could have been redeemed. That's sad, because these delightful characters surely deserved better.\"}"}]}

What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did.\"}"}]}

My travels didn't cover the whole country, just the western half, so I can't speak for all of the book's recommendations. But, in general, I found it immensely helpful, both for planning my trip and for day-to-day guidance while traveling. Some comments:1. Slovenia's currency hasn't stabilized yet, so expect prices to vary upward, especially now that the Euro is so high against the dollar. Big deal; it's still a comparatively inexpensive country. (I went to a rip-off-the-tourists but very good restaurant in Ljubljana, had a full dinner and a half-liter of wine -- and my total bill was $20!)2. The famous disappearing Lake Cerknicka does indeed disappear for a large part of the year, so it's likely that all you'll see is a bumpy plain covered with grass. On a related subject, the Soca River valley is beautiful, but in the fall the water is low, so anyone expecting a kayaker's paradise would be disappointed.3. Renting a car is expensive, and the train and bus system, while not perfect, is still very good. So I used this book to plan ahead: I took public transportation most of the time, then rented a car for one day to visit some areas that are difficult or impossible any other way (e.g., the church at Hrastovlje, which is amazing even if you're not a fan of medieval religious art).4. The church of St. John the Baptist near Lake Bohinj, with the interesting medieval wall paintings, is closed for repairs, completion date uncertain. However, if you walk up the road to Stara Fuzina, the church there has some arguably medieval paintings in the front porch; it's a lovely walk, too, and you can continue on to Studor and admire the antique hayracks.5. I totally agree with the book's description of the Skocjan Caves: I'm not a big fan of caves, but these were special, and fully worth the effort. (The tour requires considerable walking and step-climbing, so it's not for the weak or the faint-hearted.) The bus access to the site is poor, but some tour companies run day trips from Ljubljana, and the prices I saw were pretty reasonable.6. The book's restaurant recommendations are generally excellent: Delfin, in Piran, has the best grilled squid on the planet, and the mussels aren't bad either.7. Fall can be rainy: I encountered a couple of wet, chilly days that made me wish I'd brought waterproof shoes and a heavier raincoat. But, the rest of the time, it was warm enough that I wore sandals.8. In the fall, many museums and other sights cut back their hours drastically, so be sure to check before you go, especially if a long trip is involved. (I arrived too late for the day's last tour of Sneznik Castle; on the other hand, I visited the Dormouse Museum -- which is utterly mad and not to be missed -- and hung out in the pub next door with the locals practicing their English on me, and that was way more fun than seeing some rich German family's old furniture!)\"}"}]}

Only a genius can write something like this, predicting the future decades ahead. The writer concerned about the decline of reading culture, taken over by audio-visual culture, such as TV and now, the Internet.

Even some publisher in my country are afraid to print books which are sensitive, afraid that it might offend certain group. Just months ago, the publisher burn the book because of the pressure of religious group, a book writer which are beaten because her ideas are blasphemous. If this continues, the days when publishers stop publishing books about ideas, because it might offend people, are closer than we think.This books are inline with Marshall McLuhan's The Medium is The Messageand Neil Postman'sAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

In River City, where magic used to thrive and is now fading, the witches who once ruled the city along with their powerful King have become all but obsolete. The city's crumbling government is now controlled primarily by the new university and teaching hospital, which has grown to take over half of the city. Moving between the decaying Old City and the ruthless New, four young queer people struggle with the daily hazards of life\u2014work, school, dodging ruthless cops and unscrupulous scientists\u2014not realizing that they have been selected to play in an age-old drama that revives the flow of magic through their world. When a mysterious death rocks their fragile peace, the four are brought into each other's orbits as they uncover a deeper magical conspiracy. Devastating, gorgeous, and utterly unique, We All Fall Down examines the complex network of pain created by power differentials, even between people who love each other\u2014and how it is possible to be queer and turn out just fine.\", \"authors\": \"['Rose Szabo']\", \"publisher\" : \"Farrar, Straus and Giroux (BYR)\", \"text\" : \"A book on the Rapture time of Revelations.

Other than the people who are obviously the author's friends and colleagues, one has to back up from all of the reviews, and ask -- What is the author trying to convey?That is the question here? In this book, some people have mistaken snappy or crass dialog, along with shocking sex and violence, as a good book.In this book, since a Devil-controlled man rules the world, mankind has reached new lows of debauchery. And just because the author is able to really show how degrading some aspects of society are in the absence of the rule of natural or God's law, does not mean that this book is a success?As a case in point: There is a chapter in the book that occurs near the beginning of the book, in which the protagonist of the book, Jimmy, witnesses the rape and murder of a male Christian youth while travelling on a prison ship from Eurasia to North America.Is this shocking -- you bet it is.But what is the author trying to convey? That the average person of the book will stoop to this level as the book progresses? No, because the protagonist Jimmy never even comes close to sinking to that low level. That the average man or woman will sink to that level. No, because none of Jimmy's friends remotely do the same.So the reader comes away with the feeling that one has about rapists and murderers who are in prison -- that that is just how rapists and murderers are-- brute beasts.The protagonist never changes, at all, over the course of the entire 6 1/2 years of the book. He is a selfish twit in the beginning of the book, and he is a selfish twit and the end.I shall not give away the last \"chapter\", actually expanded paragraph of the book, but it is really not explained very well at all. That is a shame, consdiering all of the feelings and emotions that could have been explained by the protagonist Jimmy.Maybe a warning about his new eternal state. Maybe a line of evangelism during this moment. A terrible wasted opportunity. Hundreds of teenage readers are reading your book, Mr Caldwell, but for some reason you did not close the deal.Which leaves the reader wondering, once again, what is this book trying to accomplish? Christian evangelism? Christian apologetics? A skimmed over porno novel? We do not know.Do not put down and trod over the Left Behind series. It knows where it is going, and it knows what it wants. A Christian evangelistic novel designed to present the end of this age, and to convert the reader to a belief system in Jesus Christ.Who knows what Mr Caldwell wants? That is why, as neither a friend, acquaintaince, or foe; from the other side of America, I must say -- even Mr. Caldwell does not know what he wants out of this book.\"}"}]}

Among the most empowering of the forgotten elements are references to a science with the power to bring everlasting healing to our bodies and initiate an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between governments and nations. In his groundbreaking new book, The Isaiah Effect, Gregg Braden turns to the Isaiah Scroll, perhaps the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1946, to offer insight into a powerful form of ancient prayer. In The Isaiah Effect, Braden, author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, combines research in quantum physics with the works of the prophet Isaiah and the ancient Essenes. He demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom, and that we have the power to influence those possibilities. In addition to describing multiple futures, the Isaiah texts take us one step further, clearly describing the science of how we choose our futures. Tracing key words of Isaiah's text back to their original language, we discover how he taught a mode of prayer that was lost to the West during Biblical editing in the fourth century. Braden offers detailed accounts of how elements of this mode of prayer have been applied in a variety of situations, ranging from healing life-threatening conditions to entire villages using collective prayer to prevail during the 1998 fires in southern Peru. In each instance, the correlation between the offering of the prayer and a shift of the events in question was beyond coincidence--the prayers had measurable effects! As modern science continues to validate a relationship between our outer and inner worlds, it becomes more likely that a forgotten bridge links the world of our prayers with that of our experience. Each time we engage ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities with Isaiah's life-affirming message of hope, we secure nothing less than our future and the future of the only home we know.\", \"authors\": \"['Gregg Braden']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harmony\", \"text\" : \"The author is an amazingly talented man..

Defying our stereotypes about the Muslim world, Brooks' acute analysis of the world's fastest growing religion deftly illustrates how Islam's holiest texts have been misused to justify repression of women, and how male pride and power have warped the original message of a once liberating faith. As a prizewinning foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, Geraldine Brooks spent six years covering the Middle East through wars, insurrections, and the volcanic upheaval of resurgent fundamentalism. Yet for her, headline events were only the backdrop to a less obvious but more enduring drama: the daily life of Muslim women.\", \"authors\": \"['Geraldine Brooks']\", \"publisher\" : \"Anchor\", \"text\" : \"When I picked up this book, I could not put it down. Everything about this book fasinated me: the connections to ancient Islamic hadith, the lives of specific women, and the overlying comparisions on treatment of women in the Middle East. One by one, Brooks takes issues she encountered while living there and address each on its own. She laces individual stories with greater events and observations, trying not to make judgments - until the end. Then she sets forth with a fury and I can't help but admire the way in which she puts forth her arguments.The book was clearly written for a Western audience unfamiliar with most Islamic traditions and that happened to work out nicely for me as I just happened to be that kind of audience. This book was not meant for people very familiar with Islam and the Middle East, if you are and plan to read this book, I would suggest patience as Brooks explains many things you might already know.The biggest flaw is the structure of the book, which seems to jump around alot and isn't bound by a central theme or string (other than Islamic women, of course). Each chapter stands on its own and address a different topic, which makes it nice to read, but negates the impact of the conclusion. The other problem is one of age. The book was written over ten years ago and most of the interviews took place during the late 80s, early 90s. This impacts the discussion of nations in the book, especially for Afghanistan and Iraq (of course). However, I did not find it that distracting as most of the book discusses the women and their every day life.In all, I would recommend this book, especially to people interested in Women's Studies or the Middle East. It's light reading and fasinating, so anyone interested in those topics should get around to reading it sooner or later.\"}"}]}

Rich in culture, art, and charm, the Eternal City is also home to some of the most delicious and accessible cooking in all of Italy. Influenced by both the earthy peasant fare of the surrounding hillsides and the fish from the nearby Mediterranean, Roman food makes the most of local ingredients and simple, age-old techniques. Yet while Italian cookbooks abound, no American book has focused on Romes unique and varied fare. In this beautifully illustrated cookbook, author David Downie and photographer Alison Harris offer a comprehensive collection of more than 125 Roman recipes, exploring the lively, uncomplicated food traditionally served in Roman homes and trattorie. From well-known dishes like Spaghetti Carbonara, to popular snack food like Pizza Bianca, to distinctive specialties like Roast Suckling Lamb, each recipe in Cooking the Roman Way is simple, authentic, and easy to make at home. With four-color photographs of landmarks, markets and food, stories about and profiles of food vendors, entertaining anecdotes, and a food lovers guide to the streets of the city, this book paints a vivid picture of Rome and the food that has sustained it for millennia.\", \"authors\": \"['David Downie']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harper Collins\", \"text\" : \"Two books on Roman cooking have appeared within the last eighteen (18) months, which gives us a golden opportunity to proof one against the other to find the better book. The first published last year, the current subject, is `Cooking the Roman Way' by David Downie. The second is the more recently published book `In a Roman Kitchen: Timeless Recipes from the Eternal City' by Jo Bettoja.In general, Downie's book appears to be based more on restaurante, trattoria, and osteria recipes while Bettoja seems to rely more on home cooking recipes. Still, there is a significant overlap of recipe names. I had no trouble at all finding five recipes with the same traditional Italian name, although the English translation of the name may have been a little different. I give high marks to both authors for giving the Italian names of all dishes in both the text and the index.I compared the recipes for five dishes:Gnocchi di Semolino alla RomanaSpaghetti alla CarbonaraCipolline in Agrodolce alla RomanaCarciofi alla GiudiaFrittata con ZucchiniAlthough no pair of recipes was the same, I can find virtually nothing in these five recipes which would suggest that one author was presenting consistently superior recipes. I was slightly annoyed with Downie for specifying white coctail onions in the Cipolline recipe, especially since I have no trouble finding cipolline in my local Pennsylvania megamart. My conclusion that Downie relies on the Trattoria and Bettoja relies on the home is in the sources they cite for their recipes. Both appear to give equal time to the influence of the Jewish quarter on Roman cooking.In Bettoja's case, the focus seems to be on a large number of recipes for each major type of Roman dish. She has, for example, more pasta, artichoke, and fava bean recipes than Downie, and also more dessert recipes. This is ironic since Downie controverts one of my hero Mario Batali's claims that Italians do not go in for sweets.In contrast, Downie includes many seminally Roman recipes which Bettoja simply ignores. He has excellent recipes for making both Pizza Bianco, a certifiable Roman speciality, and fresh fettucini, including sound recommendations on making the fettucini completely by hand and with the assistance of power mixers and power pasta rolling machines. Most surprising of all is that Downie includes the recipe for Gnocchi di Patate while Bettoja does not. My understanding from Mario is that this is a Roman speciality and every trattoria in Rome serves it on Thursday. Alternately, Claudia Roden identifies it as a northern (Friuli) Italian speciality. Since Downie specifically cites potato gnocchi as the Roman canonical dish for Thursday and thereby agrees with Mario, I have to assume that while the dish may be promenant outside Rome, it is certainly a distinctively Roman dish as well.Bettoja is a teacher who runs her own culinary school in Rome while Downie is a culinary journalist, so it surprises me that it is Downie who has the superior sidebars on some basic techniques such as how to clean an artichoke (sidebars with step by step photographs) and how to roast and skin sweet peppers.Even though Bettoja's book is later and even though the books have identical list prices and almost identical page counts, Downie's book is much richer in the quality and quantity of it's photographs, almost all with useful captions. I generally do not count good photography to a cookbook's credit, but in the case of a book dedicated to so photogenic a location as Rome, I must make an exception here. For the identical price, Downie and his photographer and editors have simply done a much better job. Downie's book is also richer in sidebars on general Roman and Italian culinary matters. The sidebar on the sources of Pecorino Romano, which is made in greater quanities in Sardinia than it is in Lazio, was a great surprise. His headnotes for individual dishes are also richer in explaining the history of many dishes such as Fettucini Alfredo and Fettucini alla Papalina.In the battle of the blurbs, Downie has Mario and Carol Field while Bettoja has Lidia Bastianich and Frances Mayes on her back cover. I think that's a tie.I would buy both of these books, even with the rather substantial overlap in named dishes. The overlap is actually a plus for amateur foodie scholars, as it gives one the sense of exactly how different two sources can be with exactly the same dish. Bettoja is a great source for pasta recipes and Roman desserts, while Downie has much greater success at evoking the Roman ambiance and in covering deeper techniques. Downie also wins the points on domestic sources for flour and other Italian specialities. Bettoja rather quixotically gives us the telephone numbers of companies in Rome. Not very useful unless you plan to visit Rome in the near future.Both books are recommended. If you need to choose one, I would pick Downie's book.\"}"}]}

The story of why one brother succeeds while another feels unloved is beautifully told.Adam Trask, from the first set of brothers, repeats his own story with his sons, the twins Aron and Caleb. The enduring themes of light vs. dark, good vs. evil, hatred vs. love, and always the free will, the ability to choose one's own destiny are paramount to this rich and multi-layered tale.Above all, it is the characters you will long remember from this riveting saga.

She kills her parents, beds her husband's brother on her wedding night, shoots her husband and desserts her infant sons. And, all this before she turns really bad!

This is always mixed in with plenty of other stories and information about the animal of choice. This may all seem a bit repetative, but Capsticks fantastic flair for writing, and lively and amusing prose make this anything but dull.

Jacobs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"description\": \"'The degradations, the wrongs, the vices, that grow out of slavery, are more than I can describe.' Harriet Jacobs was born a slave in the American South and went on to write one of the most extraordinary slave narratives. First published pseudonymously in 1861, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl describes Jacobs's treatment at the hands of her owners, her eventual escape to the North, and her perilous existence evading recapture as a fugitive slave. To save herself from sexual assault and protect her children she is forced to hide for seven years in a tiny attic space, suffering terrible psychological and physical pain. Written to expose the appalling treatment of slaves in the South and the racism of the free North, and to advance the abolitionist cause, Incidents is notable for its careful construction and literary effects. Jacobs's story of self-emancipation and a growing feminist consciousness is the tale of an individual and a searing indictment of slavery's inhumanity. This edition includes the short memoir by Jacobs's brother, John S. Jacobs, 'A True Tale of Slavery'.

Desjardin']\", \"publisher\" : \"Da Capo Press\", \"text\" : \"The Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- July 3, 1863) was the largest battle fought in North America and a pivotal event of the American Civil War. The battle, its causes, environs, personalities, events, among other things have been written about and memorialized endlessly, literally from the moment the troops on both sides left the battlefield.In his study \"These Honored Dead\", Thomas Desjardin examines some of the the legends that have grown around this great battle. He has written a historiography which shows how and why it is difficult to determine what in fact occured during the battle from the mass of conflicting accounts in the literature. Desjardin holds a PhD in American history. He is the author of \"Stand Firm Ye Boys from Maine\" which examines the activities of the 20th Maine and Colonel Joshua Chamberlain on Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg.Desjardin offers several reasons contributing the the difficulty of separating fact from memory in understanding a complex historical event such as the Battle of Gettysburg. First, during the battle, the participants were under, obviously, severe stress and tend to focus only on the activities under their direct observation. With the passage of years, memories tend both to fade and to become embellished.Second, after the battle many of the participants tried to shape the story for ends and meanings of their own. Thus Union General Dan Sickles tried to destroy the reputation of General Meade, the Union commander at Gettysburg, to cover Sickles's own misdeeds in moving his Third Corps to an exposed position which threatened the Federal position and resulted in great loss of life. Similarly, various Confederate writers, including General Jubal Early, tried to find scapegoats for the loss of the battle to foster a \"Lost Cause\" mythology and absolve General Robert E. Lee from blame for the defeat.Third, Gettysburg has become regarded as a key moment in understanding and giving meaning to the American experience. Historians, artists, and the public have shaped the meaning and events of the battle to meet perceived national and frequently individual ends.Desjardins examines a number of key moments of the battle, including the fighting for Little Round Top at the extreme left of the Union line on July 2 and \"Pickett's Charge\" at the center of the Union line on July 3. A great deal of mythology has grown around these two moments. With respect to Little Round Top, Desjardins examines the bases for some of the claims put forth about Joshua Chamberlain and Gouverneur Warren, among others, and concludes that a number of the claims are extravagant, unsupported by, and in some cases contradicted by the historical record. Desjardin discusses in some detail Michael Sharaa's famous novel, \"The Killer Angels\" and the television series and movie based upon it and shows the fictitious character of much of the account.A work such as Desjardin's could easily degenerate into an exercise in debunking, which is all-to-common in understanding American history. But I found Desjardin's book moving and instructive precisely because this does not happen. Desjardin discusses a battle and a battlefield that have a great deal of historical and personal resonance for him, and he takes it seriously. Gettysburg may not be, indeed, an American Valhalla, but the site is hallowed ground and it, and its combatants, have earned the study, memorializations, and legends they have received. Taking away some of the legends about Chamberlain or Warren, for example, we are left with highly impressive individuals and with incidents of heroism. Upon completing the book, I was left with the feeling that, in Gettyburg as in so much else, the truth and the search for the truth about what took place, are more impressive and shape the legends. The battle, its consequences, and meanings are properly ways in which Americans discover themselves.Readers who enjoy this book will also benefit from many other studies about the relationship between history and memory at Gettysburg. An example of such a book is Carol Reardon's \"Pickett's Charge in History and Memory\" (1997). Desjardin's book will have its greatest appeal to readers who have a background in the Battle of Gettysburg and an interest in questions of historical truth and interpretation.Robin Friedman\"}"}]}

History has judged him such a loathsome figure that even today, a half century after his death, his name remains synonymous with witch hunts. But that conventional image is all wrong, as veteran journalist and author M. Stanton Evans reveals in this groundbreaking book. The long-awaited Blacklisted by History, based on six years of intensive research, dismantles the myths surrounding Joe McCarthy and his campaign to unmask Communists, Soviet agents, and flagrant loyalty risks working within the U.S. government. Evans\u2019s revelations completely overturn our understanding of McCarthy, McCarthyism, and the Cold War. Drawing on primary sources\u2014including never-before-published government records and FBI files, as well as recent research gleaned from Soviet archives and intercepted transmissions between Moscow spymasters and their agents in the United States\u2014Evans presents irrefutable evidence of a relentless Communist drive to penetrate our government, influence its policies, and steal its secrets. Most shocking of all, he shows that U.S. officials supposedly guarding against this danger not only let it happen but actively covered up the penetration. All of this was precisely as Joe McCarthy contended.Blacklisted by History shows, for instance, that the FBI knew as early as 1942 that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the atomic bomb project, had been identified by Communist leaders as a party member; that high-level U.S. officials were warned that Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy almost a decade before the Hiss case became a public scandal; that a cabal of White House, Justice Department, and State Department officials lied about and covered up the Amerasia spy case; and that the State Department had been heavily penetrated by Communists and Soviet agents before McCarthy came on the scene.Evans also shows that practically everything we\u2019ve been told about McCarthy is false, including conventional treatment of the famous 1950 speech at Wheeling, West Virginia, that launched the McCarthy era (\u201cI have here in my hand . . .\u201d), the Senate hearings that casually dismissed his charges, the matter of leading McCarthy suspect Owen Lattimore, the Annie Lee Moss case, the Army-McCarthy hearings, and much more. In the end, Senator McCarthy was censured by his colleagues and condemned by the press and historians. But as Evans writes, \u201cThe real Joe McCarthy has vanished into the mists of fable and recycled error, so that it takes the equivalent of a dragnet search to find him.\u201d Blacklisted by History provides the first accurate account of what McCarthy did and, more broadly, what happened to America during the Cold War. It is a revealing expos\u00e9 of the forces that distorted our national policy in that conflict and our understanding of its history since.\", \"authors\": \"['M. Stanton Evans']\", \"publisher\" : \"Crown Forum\", \"text\" : \"I liked this book as an overview of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

And when I was done, when I had closed the last page, I could only take a deep breath and think, \"Damn this is going to be awesome on the screen!\"Now as for the book, it's great. Matthew Stover is an amazing author. Shatterpoint was a little better at showing Stover's gifts because of the fact he created and wrote the whole thing - not adapted it from a screenplay. But still Revenge is very, very good. It's tight, cold when it needs to be, fanciful when that's caused for. There's a lot of what's going on in the minds of the characters compared to what we are going to see on the screen. You can tell also that Stover has a love for Mace Windu. Mace has got it going on in this book. And it plays really nicely into Luceno's Labyrinth of Evil. The two fit together really well. If you were thinking of skipping Labyrinth, I would suggest rethinking that notion. Because to really enjoy the novelization and get it's references, you should read Labyrinth. And Shatterpoint. He makes a few references of Mace's time on his home planet.A few bones of contention: the last 100 pages are really sparse. The stuff that Lucas really wants you to love and drop your jaw at on the screen, Stover goes over really quickly. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is two pages, at best. I think it supposedly gets ten minutes of screen time. Also, the battle between Yoda and the Emperor is glossed over. And there are no real time spent or even glimpses of Chewie's home world. I know that Lucas is saving that for the film but still I think Stover is getting cheated as a writer because he could have done better things with it. Anakin's fight with Doku is tops, though! So is Obi-Wan's battle with Grevious!To sum it up, I really loved this book. I couldn't put it down and now that it's done, I miss it. I've read all the Prequel novels and I feel like I can close the book on Star Wars until Episode III hits the theaters. I'm glad that it ended with this book. Actually, if anyone were to read them in order, they'd get three really great books in a row with Dark Rendezvous, Labyrinth of Evil, and Revenge of the Sith.May the Force be with us all.\"}"}]}

I am a desert rat.\" - Edward Abbey in DESERT SOLITAIREI'm not sure if I've ever read anything else by Edward Abbey. Perhaps The Monkey Wrench Gang in the rebellious mid-1970s. Memory fails. But in reading DESERT SOLITAIRE, I can see why he was - he died in 1989 - so controversial. A naturalist and rugged individualist, he would be brazenly politically incorrect by today's standards while perhaps not easily categorized as either left or right-wing. I think I'm a huge fan already.Centered around a six-month stint he did as the lone, resident park ranger in Utah's Arches National Monument - now Arches National Park - in 1958, DESERT SOLITAIRE is Edward Abbey's brilliant tribute to the flora, fauna and geology of the desert Southwest in general and southeastern Utah in particular. For the reader with an active mind's eye, Abbey is at his best when he describes the immediate environs around his Arches trailer residence, his boat trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon (before the dam was built), his ascent of Mount Tukuhnikavits, and his descent into The Maze area of what is now Canyonlands National Park.Much of the controversy surrounding Abbey most certainly emanated from his scathing opinions of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and what he terms \"Industrial Tourism\", that insidiously encroaching approach that would have all wilderness areas paved over and built-up to serve hordes of automobile-enclosed tourists whose idea of experiencing the landscape is to drive through in air-conditioned comfort. Indeed, Edward thought the national parks should be accessible only to those who could walk in or ride in on bicycle or mule from huge car lots at the parks' boundaries. Sometimes, his views verge on callous:\"Children too small to ride bicycles and too heavy to be borne on their parents' backs need only wait a few years ... The aged merit even less sympathy: after all they had the chance to see the country when it was still relatively unspoiled. However, we'll stretch a point for those too old or too sickly to mount a bicycle and let them ride the shuttle buses.\"(Some that arrive in cars should stay in them. Hiking in the Grand Canyon both last March and last September, my wife and I encountered tourists waltzing down the Bright Angel Trail with Plateau Point - 6.1 miles from the rim - or the Colorado River - 7.7 miles from the rim - as their intended round trip (!) destination without carrying so much as a thimbleful of water. Luckily, there are rangers at key points to turn such fools back. You know, perhaps some selective culling of the species wouldn't hurt; I think Abbey might have agreed.)His outrage concerning the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam knows no bounds:\"No wonder the Authorities are so anxious to smother the wilderness under asphalt and reservoirs. They know what they're doing; their lives depend on it, and all their rotten institutions. Play safe. Ski only in clockwise direction. Let's all have fun together.\"And his description of the doomed Glen Canyon environment approaches the reverential:\"High above our heads the owls hoot under the lost moon. A predawn wind comes sifting and sighing through the cottonwood trees; the sound of their dry, papery leaves is like the murmur of distant water, or like the whispering of ghosts in an ancient, sacrosanct, condemned cathedral.\"Abbey's critics made much of his rejection of anthropocentrism, which is evident within the pages of DESERT SOLITAIRE:\"We need coyotes more than we need, let us say, more people, of whom we already have an extravagant surplus, or more domesticated dogs, which in all fairness could and should be ground up into hamburger and used as emergency coyote food, to raise their spirits and perhaps improve the tenor of their predawn howling.\"Happily, I'm a cat lover.However, most of the book's narrative is descriptive rather than philosophic and, at times, becomes all too real as when he tells of the desert search for a lost hiker and his own near-death experience when apparently stranded halfway down an isolated canyon wall beyond any hope of rescue.DESERT SOLITAIRE is the best book I've read all summer, and perhaps all year. I intend to acquire and read more of the author's stuff.\"}"}]}

She even has a chapter on how to make your own herb infused oils, salves and vinegars.Kathi recommends 10 basic oils (with a few added for women's issues) and gives recipes sticking mainly to those same recommended ones.

Richard the Lionhearted is portrayed as what he apparently was - a great warrior with a surprising appetite for things not often associated with soldiers. As for Saladin, it is quickly evident why he was both feared and revered, why both are deserved, and why honor is not simply a Western characteristic.\"}"}]}

Finally, common sense and logic are applied to the grandaddy of all role-playing games. As someone who has played and been a DM since prior to when the first AD&amp;D books came out, it is nice to see the removal of such artificial and ridiculous concepts as class limitations, race, and for the most part, alignment. In the old system Elves were supposed to be highly magical and Dwarves were renowned as fighters, yet the racial limitations on class resulted in these races eventually being wimps compared to human characters.The multi-class rules are a drastic improvement, again showing a bias towards common sense. The return of the half-orc race, and the barbarian and monk classes were long overdue. It will be interesting to see how the new sorcerer class and the changes to the wizard class work out, but things look promising. Changes to ability scores are a plus, as is the ability to customize characters with the skill and feat abilities.The new edition is a diamond, but it is a diamond in the rough. It appears that some additional polishing might be needed. Although many of the explanations are well done, (this contains far and away the best explanation of alignment), and there are excellent and helpful illustrations to help guide readers, the layout is a bit confusing as it relates to the expalnations of the skill and feat abilities. Also, there has not been enough clear explanation on weapon restrictions. Wizards are limited to certain listed weapons, which do not include the short bow. But Mialee, Wizards' model wizard, possesses a short bow, presumably because all elves, such as Mialee, have proficiency with bows. Clarity is needed, because elves also have proficiency with other weapons not available to the wizard class and there may be conflicts with other class restrictions, especially the druid.Another problem area is the ranger. Back when the old system first introduced skill abilities, they goofed by not automatically giving the ranger the survival skill. Wizards has similarily goofed by not automatically giving the Wilderness Lore skill to the ranger class. I mean, come on, a ranger without wilderness skills? The ranger class benefits by finally getting numerical spell equality with the paladin, and the change to the &quot;special enemy&quot; is also nice. Both changes were long overdue. However, every other special ability granted to the ranger class can be quickly duplicated by a fighter. Not enough care has been spent evaluating this character.Other changes have more of a personal taste quality: halfings are no longer Hobbit clones, but are more like Kender without wrinkles; weapons generally inflict less damage; the changes in the way spells are listed, etc.In short, vast improvements have been made, but rough edges remain which could still use refinement. A full verdict will have to wait until the DM, Monster Manuals and any supporting manuals are published to fully realize the changes which have been implemented.\"}"}]}

His life has been filled with hilarious, never-been-told stories...until now! His reign consists of thirteen championships (one of which he's held more than forty times), three marriages, and two children. He's dominated Memphis radio and television airwaves. Starred in feature films. Recorded albums. Tolerated countless sprains, broken bones, concussions, and contusions. The way Jerry \"The King\" Lawler tells it, if you're good at something, do it more than once. It's Good To Be The King...Sometimes is a no-holds-barred personal account from the \"puppies\"-pantin' King of one-liners, who steps out from behind the announcer's desk of WWE Raw to hold court about everything. His passion for art that first drew him to the ring of a rundown West Memphis movie theater over thirty years ago. The comic adventures and tragic bumps endured journeying down the \"Music Highway\" of Interstate 40 with the National Wrestling Alliance. Earning his royal personage in the Bluff City of the Mighty Mississippi against his own mentor, \"Fabulous\" Jackie Fargo. Grappling with mat legends Ric Flair, Lou Thesz, Jesse Ventura, Andre the Giant, Terry Funk, and Bret \"Hitman\" Hart. And his crowning achievements as co-ruler of the United States Wrestling Association, which contributed to the rise of future WWE Superstars Hulk Hogan, Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock. It's time you lackeys pay heed as the King reveals the schemes and outrageous storylines to many of wrestling's most fantastic theatrics and all-too-real moments. Lawler tells of his legendary \"feud\" with Andy Kaufman, and his much-publicized confrontation with the actor portraying the late comedian on the set of Man on the Moon, and the \"Karate-versus-Wrestling\" match that almost occurred between Lawler and Memphis's other King. And be sure to honor his royal proclamations regarding former wives, and his mother's opinion of wrestling; why he once sued future boss Vince McMahon...and won; and the body part he truly worships on a WWE Diva.\", \"authors\": \"['Jerry Lawler']\", \"publisher\" : \"Simon and Schuster\", \"text\" : \"\"It's Good To Be The King...Sometimes\" is the autobiography of legendary wrestling personality Jerry \"The King\" Lawler. For fans of wrestling or biographies Lawler's got a lot of stories to share and does not disappoint.For longtime wrestling fans Lawler takes a sweeping view back across his life and gives you the lowdown on just about everything from his childhood, his multiple marriages, his family, his hobbies and interests and - of course, his life in wrestling. Among the things he shares with the reader are:1. His interest in art and how it kept him out of Vietnam2. His time spent as a radio DJ3. How he broke into the wrestling business with in the Tennessee territory4. How he met each of his wives5. His connection to \"The King\" Elvis Presley6. TONS of road stories with guys like Jackie Fargo, Jerry Jarrett and Sam Bass7. The REAL story of his infamous feud with Andy Kauffman and his later filming of \"Man on the Moon\"8. A few stories about his time in the WWE9. The Story Behind the firing of the \"Kat\" and his divorce from Stacy Carter10. His running for Memphis Mayor11. Some of his \"Ring Rat\" stories (oh boy...)THE COOL STUFFIf you're a Lawler fan you'll definitely love the stories King has to share (he's got a lot of them). The book reads very much like a sit down chat with a friend as Lawler doesn't hold much back. For old school wrestling fans his stories of the old Memphis territory are the real gems in this book. For WWE fans Lawler really doesn't share too much about his WWE experiences (he does cover his Bret feud and that's about it really) that most long-time WWE fans already know about. A comic at heart Lawler does spice the book out with a bunch of his one-liners he'll use of commentary which was pretty funny.THE VERDICTIf you love bios Lawler's a good one for you. You come away from the book knowing the guy's poured his heart out to you (kudos to him for being able to open up his heart about all his failed marriages). You get some nice stories about art, music, wrestling, life on the road, a bunch of good one liners and some pretty nasty tales about all the ladies he's met over the years. Yup, this one's got it all.Highly RecommendedTotal Pages: 384Total Read Time: About 9 hours over 6 nights\"}"}]}

Get yourself at least one good general cookbook that assumes you know absolutely nothing about cooking.How to Cook Everything is exactly this kind of book. Mark Bitterman's receipes will be interesting enough for experienced cooks but the directions are clear enough for newbies. Using this book you can learn to make bread or jam. But you don't have to. You can just learn to make decent soup, roasts, steaks and salads. He really will teach you everything, so you don't have to worry too much about not knowing the lingo. Just make sure and read the initial introduction and the introductions to each chapter.Mark Bitterman has a good sense of what people like to eat these days so unlike some of the more traditional general cookbooks (Fannie Farmer, Joy of Cooking), you get a selection of easy to make modern meals (like tacos) along with things like beef stew.Having said that, I have to admit that I like this book very much but don't quite love it as much as my traditional books which I would recommend to suplement this one.. It won't actually take the place of my Fannie Farmer or my Basic Cookbook because it seems less rooted in the traditions of American cooking. Bitterman is great at the variations that make up today's cooking but when it comes to the classics, I find myself turning to those older books which explain not only how to make things like Johnny Cakes but their origins.Having said that this is a good book to have around if you suddenly want to learn to make pancakes, or banana bread or if you want to find a variation on the boring stew you have been making for years. Buy it as a present for newlyweds or your college grad leaving home--then tell them to have you for dinner!\"}"}]}

At one point Kiyosaki says that rich buy assets and the poor buy liabilites. Basically an asset pays you without you doing anything - for example interest from the bank. Likewise a liability takes money without you doing anything. (Although he does point out that in the case of a house and a car both require continuous money for up keep but may be needed for other reasons.) For me assessing whether I was aquiring assets or liabilities was a breakthrough in how to look at things. I'm not rich and unlikely to be so (which I'll get to next paragraph), but it has very much helped me to clarify how I think about spending.Kiyosaki also gives advice about specific types of investment strategies. Many of them take more daring than I have (and that's why I will never be rich although with longer term planning I will likely do OK). However all are based on the same strategy of aquireing assets. Which goes into why reading the book might be good even though I just gave the big secret away. For example in speculating in real estate Kiyosaki is especially clear on an asset being something that you don't have to continually manage. In this case have someone else who is unclogging toilets for your tenants. Treat this employee well and tip your broker and generally pay attention to and be generous with people who are part of your assets.Basically this is a good book to clarify your strategies involving money. Even if you are cautious like me it is helpful in terms of helping you clarify how you think about money. I don't think it can make you \"get rich quick\" but it is still very good to have read it.

Life without Frank Minna, the charismatic King of Brooklyn, would be unimaginable, so who cares if the tasks he sets them are, well, not exactly legal.

The story itself is more reality based than many of Lethem's other works, but in no way is it any less original. Motherless Brooklyn revolves around a group of unofficial private detectives, quasi-tough guys who have been working together since they were fourteen when they were plucked out of a Brooklyn orphanage by a crime Lord wannabe. The main character, Lionel Essrog, has an unlikely affliction for a private detective: he suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. He is obsessed with words, numbers, touching, and often finds it difficult to control himself. I don't know if it's a natural progression of writing about someone with Tourette's or premeditated, just another stroke of Lethem's usual genius, but the entire novel is written with just the kind of snappy and bouncy rhythym that would please Lionel greatly. It teases you into re-reading sentences and taunts you into peeking at pages you shouldn't be peeking at yet. The action will make you bite your nails and the mystery will render you incapable of putting the book down, but the real beauty lies in Lethem's characterization. Each character is multi-faceted and so human you can see them. You will miss them you're finished.

He is the author of Walter Benjamin, The Politics of Being: The Political Thought of Martin Heidegger, and The Terms of Cultural Criticism: The Frankfurt School, Existentialism and Poststructuralism.\", \"authors\": \"['Richard Wolin']\", \"publisher\" : \"MIT Press\", \"text\" : \"This fascinating collection exposes Heidegger as a lifelong, unrepentant National Socialist. In 1936, Heidegger agreed `without reservation' with the suggestion that \"his partisanship for National Socialism lay in the essence of his philosophy.\" He saw his political decision as a realisation of the analytic of Being and Time. He said that his concept of `historicity' was the basis of his political `engagement'.Being and Time distinguished between ontology and its `factical' actualisation in everyday life: this is idealism, the claim that there is a reality beyond real life, real history. It rejects everyday life, science, and all thought since ancient Greece. Husserl spoke of Heidegger's `disregard for scientific rigour'.Heidegger wrote in 1933 of `the will to the historical spiritual mission of the German Volk as a Volk'. He saw Being as rooted in earth and blood, `the forces that are rooted in the soil and blood of a Volk'. The Germans were `the metaphysical people'. Only the Volk was real, authentic, only they could break through the `inauthenticity' of daily life to reality. This obviously denied our common humanity.With Nietzsche, Heidegger stressed the `order of rank', the division of human Being into masters and slaves - the conventional, stupid view.In a 1949 lecture, he said, \"Agriculture is today a motorized food industry, in essence the same as the manufacture of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps.\" This is not so much Holocaust-denial as Holocaust-normalisation.Those whom Heidegger has influenced have imbibed all too much of his nihilism. Many of his French supporters have become Holocaust-deniers: one becomes what one defends. Jean Beaufret, his most stalwart advocate in France, is a Holocaust-denier who has defended Robert Faurisson, the French `historian' who denies the existence of gas chambers and the Holocaust.

Seriously, if you can't see the color on a simple block, you're not going to see it when a vast landscape of forests, mountains, and lakes are placed in front of you.So if you want some good exercises about seeing color, get the book, and do the exercises! A verbal understanding of what the book says isn't good enough, you need to actually do the exercises (a lot) in order to comprehend what it's really talking about.But if you want a book about drawing, get Tony Ryder's book.\"}"}]}

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.\", \"authors\": \"['Alexandre Dumas']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"I must say, after seeing that the length reached nearly 1500 pages, I was a little concerned about the content, however, I found this book to be the best book I have read.

At certain points in the book the number of characters made me loose track of some people, but they appeared later and were quite obviously presented to me. The plot is great, story is great, everything about it is great. Read it!\"}"}]}

W. Norton & Company\", \"text\" : \"This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right. Each provides a concise but remarkably comprehensive biography of its subject in combination with a penetrating analysis of the significance of that subject's life and career. I think this is a brilliant concept. Those who wish to learn more about the given subject are directed to other sources.When preparing to review various volumes in this series, I have struggled with determining what would be of greatest interest and assistance to those who read my reviews. Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding remarks would be appropriate.On misconceptions of Mozart (e.g. the &quot;willful child&quot; unable to grow up, the \"miracle worker\" who never needed to revise a single note): \"These tenacious caricatures are distortions rather than fabrications; most of them, as we shall discover, contain a kernel of truth....But Mozart's life in music is fascinating enough without embroidery; his reputation as a genius is not threatened by mundane truths.\" (Page 2)In a letter to his father (1781): \"Nature speaks as loudly in me as in anyone, and perhaps louder than in many big, strong lugs. I cannot possibly live like most of the young men today. -- First, I have too much religion; secondly, too much love for my fellow beings and too honorable a disposition to seduce an innocent girl; and thirdly, too much horror and repugnance, dread and fear of diseases, and too much care for my health to scuffle with whores.\" (Page 70)Peter Gay on Salieri: \"There is an all-too-well-known melodramatic tale about Antonio Salieri poisoning Mozart. It began as a rumor and was first given literary form in the 1820s in a verse playlet by Pushkin. It is a malicious, preposterous fabrication, but hints at the envy Mozart's rivals had every right to feel. Yet Mozart, too, had grounds for envy: Salieri, born in Italy but long settled in Vienna, occupied privileged posts that Mozart would have deserved but, given Emperor Joseph's predilection for Salieri, could never hope to obtain.\" (Page 100)Mozart's last year: \"[It] has often been described as one long preparation for death. But in that time, Mozart wrote two operas, a piano concerto, a large number of minuets and counterdances, a clarinet concerto, a Masonic cantata, two quintets, and most of the Requiem. His creativity was still working at full speed.\" (Page 156)I am among those who have seen the film Amadeus many times, admiring it more each time. For dramatic purposes, those who produced Amadeus focus on several of the \"tenacious caricatures\" to which Gay refers. What I especially appreciate about this biography is that Gay duly acknowledges all of Mozart's human limitations and inadequacies while examining Mozart's creative discipline in ways and to an extent which the film does not. With regard to this biography's context, Gay tells his reader only what is essential to know about the various cities in which Mozart lived and worked during various periods in his all-too-brief life (January 27,1756-December 5, 1791). Rather than create an historical or cultural context, Gay prefers to focus primarily on Mozart's art. As he notes, the renewal of interest more than a century after Mozart's death raised his music -- \"all of it -- to the eminence it deserves.\"\"}"}]}

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap. \u201cSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,\u201d comments Jim Collins, \"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.\u201d Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\", \"authors\": \"['Jim Collins']\", \"publisher\" : \"HarperBusiness\", \"text\" : \"1. Put a Level 5 leader in place:This person should have intense ambitions for the company, rather than for themselves. They also should be an effective leader, competent manager, contributing team member and a highly capable individual. If you can't do this first, start working on the other steps and a Level 5 leader may emerge.2. Get the right people on your bus before you make other key decisions:Decisions about vision, strategy, organizational structure and tactics cannot be made until you have first made sure you have the right people on your team, and that they are in the correct positions. You also need to get rid of people who should not be there.3. Confront the brutal facts:When you work hard to understand the reality of your current situation, the correct decisions often emerge. Great companies tend to have cultures in which people have many opportunities to be heard.4. Understand three critical areas:Understand three things: in what areas can your firm be the best in the world; what are you passionate about; what are the drivers of your economic engine? Set your goals based on in-depth understanding of these areas, not on what Collins calls bravado.5.

The author portrays her in a way that makes you sympathetic toward her but without too much glossing over the not-so-nice aspects of her personality. She was a complicated person, placed in a complicated situation, and I like the way the author had Anne choosing to get the most for herself out of a situation she would have rather avoided entirely but could not due to King Henry's determination to have her.

All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose. JRR Tolkien's great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.\", \"authors\": \"['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien']\", \"publisher\" : \"HarperCollins UK\", \"text\" : \"A new wave of readers are devouring \"The Fellowship of the Ring,\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \"The Hobbit\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \"Mad Baggins\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \"feel\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \"The Hobbit\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \"little guy\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \"everyhobbit.\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \"Hobbit\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \"Fellowship of the Ring\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again.\"}"}]}

So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team - and the beginning of the legend. The Junction Boys tells the story of Coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant's legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined. Only a handful of players survived the entire 10 days, but they braved the intense heat of the Texas sun and the burning passion of their coach, and turned a floundering team into one of the nation's best. The Junction Boys is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers, and The Last Picture Show, these young men and their driven coach come to life. The Junction Boys contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America's love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.\", \"authors\": \"['Jim Dent']\", \"publisher\" : \"Macmillan\", \"text\" : \"First, readers must realize that Jim Dent's nonfiction novel \"The Junction Boys\" is an enjoyable recreation of one of the most famous stories in Texas football history. Secondly, one must know that the most inept hack could pound out an entertaining tome about this often-told tale.It has everything - a larger-than-life football coach in Paul Bear Bryant, a supporting cast of coaches/players to be in Gene Stallings, Jack Pardee and John David Crow, and a small town locale in Junction, Texas as colorful as anything Larry McMurtry ever dreamed of in \"The Last Picture Show.\"So one can partially forgive Dent's penchant for waxing a bit too poetic when describing every Texas cliche in the book. This story has always had \"Hollywood\" written all over it and Dent, a former sportswriter who himself must dream of the lofty heights of the already-mentioned McMurtry (refer to A&M; defeat of Texas contrasted with a simultaneous thunderstorm breaking the drought in Junction), milks this tale for all it's worth.I didn't learn much from Dent's story, as the drought-ridden conditions of Junction, Texas at the time of this football camp has been told millions of times add nauseum; the 100-plus players dwindling to 35 has become a sort of sacred mantra by every small town football coach in modern history; and the climb to an undefeated season two short years later usually concludes what has become a popular campfire story across the plains of West Texas.What I liked about \"The Junction Boys\" was the colorful interpretation of the early years of the legendary Paul Bear Bryant. Texas A & M was where this coach cut his teeth, or more accurately, began to lay the foundation for his conservative coaching beliefs and monument status. Bryant is a character who at times, makes Abraham Lincoln or even Babe Ruth, if you will, seem like a pale Gerald Ford with the flu. After reading \"The Junction Boys,\" it's not difficult to see why the colorful Coach Bryant won national championships and collegiate games with amazing consistency.The problems I have with Dent's novel is the lack of substance in detailing how the ramifications of those 10 days in Junction would shape football careers and the collegiate game (negatively and positively). The author rarely states his opinions about the dated and at times brutally harsh methods of Coach Bryant. And the fact that a player nearly died of heat stroke during this waterless preseason camp is treated with awe and respect rather than appropriate abomination.But this was a different era of sports, if not society, and the most compelling passages of Dent's novel are in the recreation of a time (1954) long since past. The story is just a few years removed from World War II, and the grit and determination which enabled this country to survive that horror is the residue which led to the Junction football experiment.Many players and officials to this day bemoan the tactics used by Coach Bryant in Junction, Texas and Dent, to his discredit, only scratches the surface of these naysayer opinions. A better rounded more substantial novel would have given this quiet minority a bit more ink. But Dent is only telling a tale, rather than digging beneath the dusty, cactus-covered surface\"The Junction Boys\" is a terrific read and certainly does this incredible story justice. If the waters, much like the drought-ridden rivers of the South Llano River near Junction, run a bit shallow, then perhaps it is good that the reader only invests 289 pages of time.\"}"}]}

Most Americans don't even know they live at the center of an empire, the absurdity of it! Anyway, if you are like me, you also smell something bad about our economy, that things just don't add up. In this book, Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin go into a tremendous amount of detail to spell it out very clearly why our economy is basically a house of cards. It's all in the details, and the authors first discuss a short history of past empires and why almost all end in a disaster of one sort or another, this is presented in breathtaking clarity. Also wrote about is the tribute empires of the past have collected, and the seemingly endless wars that empires engage themselves in. Empires have an almost unlimited need for imperial finance, and much is written about this. Are we, in the USA, becoming a third-world country? The authors bring this up, perhaps we are...slowly. Consider this, notice how many people you know that are in a service job, versus in a job such as farming, manufacturing, mining, fisheries. Kind of sad! This book brings up the well known fact that consumers in the USA import approximately 700 billion dollars more than the USA exports, the authors write about the consequences of this...what would happen if this were stopped, and they state that this large imbalance cannot continue forever. Then there is the federal budget deficit, the housing bubble, and consumers spending beyond their means. Not to mention 'peak oil' which is not even discussed in this book, and it all adds up to one potential mess. But anything goes to support the imperial forces, manipulate the marginal voter, and a thousand other things, the empire must go forward at whatever the costs, voter opinion and world opinion be damned, if necessary, Bonner and Wiggin tell it all. How the American empire will end, and Americans going back to being a humble republic as some of our founding fathers meant us to be, Bonner and Wiggin offer some ideas but offer no timescale, and rightly so, the issues are just too complicated. But they state time and again that no empire lasts forever. As a tax payer in the USA I do find it disgusting that the military budget in the USA is equal to the entire military expenditures of the rest of the world, we never recieved the peace dividend at the end of the cold war, we were scammed, in my and many others' opinions, and now we fight fake terror wars across the globe as \"world improvers\", as Bonner and Wiggin state it, in places where people hate us and don't care about our ideas and values. Well, greed and stupidity abound!If empires are indeed irresitible, as the authors claim, then I propose a new type of empire, one that goes upward, not outward. Let us reign in military spending and increase spending on space exploration, and literally aim for the stars, colonizing as we go. Expanding the human presence in space would be empire building, but in a positive way, not destructive. Well, enough of my rant, just read this book, it is fascinating stuff, and funny at times.\"}"}]}

I have finished the first fifth of the book and am convinced that it is the greatest literary work that I have read since my youthful exposure to Proust and the early novels of Saul Bellow. Mendelsohn combines a personal memoir of growing up in a \"modern\" Jewish family in America with historical detective work based on old photographs, recovered letters, interviews, trips, internet sites devoted to the little towns of Eastern Europe and Jewish genealogy, and couches it in the most beautiful and evocative and thoughtful sentences, often based on the style of Proust (to whom he has given the opening epigraph of the book), organizing his discussion around an analysis of the first book of the Torah (even mentioning my Haftorah passage, Lech lecha) and Homer's Iliad. He brings to life long lost people, places, philosophical issues, with drama and mystery. He has assembled a complete genealogy of his family and has testified to the power of memory, language (Yiddish, Hebrew, German), family love, pride and humor. He is unfailingly generous in his descriptions and conclusions. The book is illustrated with photographs taken by his younger brother. The parallels with our own family history, our life in New York and in Florida, the impact of parents on the intellectual growth of their children, the impact of religious stories and scholarship, the diaspora to America and Israel, are incredibly resonant and moving, and all this in the first 70 pages. I am writing to urge each of you to read this great book and learn how you came to be, how your own grandfather and I came to be, the people that we are. I am sorry that I never accomplished a similar work on the history of our own family. I can only hope that one or all of you will take on this important task and assemble a similarly amazing chronicle before the people who can help you are gone, the Magdas and Pop Pops, the grandma Lillys and \"Uncles\" from all the remaining branches of our living candelabra. On page 41 he lists the major sources by which he accomplished the feat and by which you, like Proust, can recapture the past and recapture Time.

Though she loves to fight with her sisters, her tough exterior protects a vulnerable heart that worries about her family's future.\", \"authors\": \"['Rey Terciero']\", \"publisher\" : \"Little, Brown Books for Young Readers\", \"text\" : \"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family.\"}"}]}

That I believe is Tolkien's true genius, his ability to construct this world in his head and to let us visit it, completely and fully for four glorious books. However, maybe that is not the extent of his genius. Maybe not because Tolkien also tells a ripping good tale throughout these novels. The prelude with Bilbo being swept up by a band of dwarves and being sent against his will to battle a dragon takes about a night to read, despite the fact that it covers over 300 pages. And then you start the true trilogy, and the ring that Bilbo finds which seemed like a neat little trick in The Hobbit (it grants the wearer the benefit of invisibility) this ring is suddenly so much more than a very handy parlor trick. It is THE ring; crafted ages ago in elven halls with unspeakable power and unfightable draw. Men kill for it, dwarves kill for it, everyone would kill for it and suddenly you are swept off on another adventure with another unsuspecting hobbit that covers all of middle earth and includes the fate of the world...all over this little unassuming ring that must be destroyed. The journey you take in these books will not easily be forgotten, here I am getting chills thinking about the epic battles between good and evil that spring up like weeds around the path of this little ring and Frodo, the hobbit who is charged with destroying it.

Highly recommended.\"\u2014Library Journal (starred review) In this gorgeously written and spellbinding historical novel based on Pride and Prejudice, the author of The Clergyman\u2019s Wife combines the knowing eye of Jane Austen with the eroticism and Gothic intrigue of Sarah Waters to reimagine the life of the mysterious Anne de Bourgh. As a fussy baby, Anne de Bourgh was prescribed laudanum to quiet her, and now the young woman must take the opium-heavy tincture every day. Growing up sheltered and confined, removed from sunshine and fresh air, the pale and overly slender Anne grew up with few companions except her cousins, including Fitzwilliam Darcy. Throughout their childhoods, it was understood that Darcy and Anne would marry and combine their vast estates of Pemberley and Rosings. But Darcy does not love Anne or want her. After her father dies unexpectedly, leaving her his vast fortune, Anne has a moment of clarity: what if her life of fragility and illness isn\u2019t truly real? What if she could free herself from the medicine that clouds her sharp mind and leaves her body weak and lethargic? Might there be a better life without the medicine she has been told she cannot live without? In a frenzy of desperation, Anne discards her laudanum and flees to the London home of her cousin, Colonel John Fitzwilliam, who helps her through her painful recovery. Yet once she returns to health, new challenges await. Shy and utterly inexperienced, the wealthy heiress must forge a new identity for herself, learning to navigate a \u201cseason\u201d in society and the complexities of love and passion. The once wan, passive Anne gives way to a braver woman with a keen edge\u2014leading to a powerful reckoning with the domineering mother determined to control Anne\u2019s fortune . . . and her life. An extraordinary tale of one woman\u2019s liberation, The Heiress reveals both the darkness and light in Austen\u2019s world, with wit, sensuality, and a deeply compassionate understanding of the human heart.\", \"authors\": \"['Molly Greeley']\", \"publisher\" : \"HarperCollins\", \"text\" : \"I picked a 20-year old copy of this novel for ten cents at a local library sale, and boy did it turn out to be a gem. After the first few chapters, I traded the soiled, crusty copy for the more recent ereads publisher version. My first thoughts are confusion. This story is so remarkable that I can't quite understand why so few copies are in circulation. Heiress is categorized as a romance, but its so much more than that. It is a spectacular story written in a unique backdrop that offers readers an opportunity both to learn and to change their ways. One reviewer once commented that Les Miserables can teach us to want to be better people. I believe this book accomplishes the same. Its the story of two siblings who let jealousy, pride, and hatred turn into cancers that can and often destroy them. Its a lesson in itself on how pride can cause a person to knowingly sabotage him/herself in attempts to hurt others. Its also a lesson on how such negative emotions can cause a person to lose any sense of authentic perception. The plot is spectacular as well, considering that it digresses from and adds a lot more to the typical romance. There were no moments of predictability. It reads more like both a wonderful soap opera and a great piece of literature. This is the type of story you'll carry with you, and its a recommend keep for any bookshelf.SPOILER ALERTMy only disappointment in this story is that both daughters of Dean knew that Dean's love affair hurt everyone involved, yet both daughters are parties to the same actions in their own marriages. Neither one of them avoid achieving the same transgression for simple purposes that they won't let history repeat itself. With that said, maybe Dailey included such actions to show that love can win in the end While other reviewers are upset that the sisters' relationship ended as it did, I believe Dailey wrote the most appropriate ending in terms of what can be reasonable. Closure was set, and relief was brought to the siblings. No relationship as rivalrous as theirs was could truly make a 180 turn toward sincere amicability.\"}"}]}

Written with the goal of giving students a thorough understanding of the basic concepts of physics in all its aspects, the text uses interesting applications to biology, medicine, architecture, and digital technology to show students how useful physics is in their own everyday lives and in their future professions.\", \"authors\": \"['Douglas C. Giancoli']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"This is a long review, but I'd appreciate it if you would invest your time in it anyways.This book was obviously not written for self-study. It is, in my view, meant to be used as a resource along with many others. I have read all of the reviews on here and it seems that almost everyone who is complaining is a student with a bad teacher or an individual trying to use this book without help, and most who are complimenting have the point of view of people who are well-learned in physics and are using this text to aid their teaching. The greatest downfall of this book is, as has been pointed out by many others, that the problems in each chapter are much harder than any of the explanations or examples.The reason for this difference in difficulty level, I believe, is that Giancoli wants to promote learning Physics, not regurgitating it. Not that there is anything wrong with merely reading and then applying what you've read, but when you discover the more detailed aspects and most intriguing applications of the subject matter by yourself, not only does it keep you interested but it gives you a whole new outlook on physics, science, and life in general.I have been using this book in an AP Physics class for a few months now, and I am amazed how much it has warped my thinking. The explanations in Giancoli's text are so well-presented, so down-to-earth, that I can't help thinking about applications of what I have learned everywhere I go. While I walk on conrete I think friction, friction, friction on each step. I think about what I have learned in class while I push furniture, try to stay warm in the cold winter air, toss trash into a trashcan, try to hold a door closed during a bout of sibling rivalry, and why my ice cream floats in my rootbeer float.To get full use out of this book you really need someone to help you understand it all, to show you the solutions to problems, and to help fill in holes in the conceptual explanations. Maybe a solutions guide would be the best way to fulfill this role, but I would argue that it is not. A solutions guide cannot answer any questions not relating particularly to the problem at hand, cannot explain its reasoning behind a given method of equation-solving, and cannot shed another point of view on a concept. It cannot take the place of a good teacher.Also, to discount the widely-held view that this volume requires an extensive basis in trigonometry and calculus, I would present that I have have never taken any courses in either of these subjects, and I am at the top of my class. The only trigonometry I've had to know so far is sin = opp/hyp and cos = adj/hyp. The rest I can deduce myself, or, if I have real trouble, look at the appendix section in the back covering trigonometric proofs, identities, and rules. Calculus has not come up at all.Maybe it's just me, maybe it's that I love math anyways, maybe it's that our class has one of the best Physics teachers in the state, maybe I would do even better with another textbook. However, since I started this course physics has been taking over my mind, and I wouldn't like to be brainwashed by any book other than Giancoli.\"}"}]}

The interactions seemed very real; the bizarreness of the events very much like real life.Of course this is more of a serious novel than a thriller, as expected of John le Carre. The mood is gray and cluody, and the ending is distressing. The story follows a young employee of an almost-defunct intelligence department.

They prepare to send a poorly-trained man of forty into East Germany as a spy. At the final betrayal, our protagonist cries in anger and shame.Those reading this book for getting kicks out of following the heroic adventures of a glamorous spy, sent to do the right thing by the right side, will be disappointed. There's no clear distinction between good and bad sides. The enemy people (east germans) are all too human. As in life, much is ambivalent.This is not an action-packed thriller to make a feel-good hollywood movie from.

Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, the Master Quilter, has her own reasons for preferring a quiet, even subdued, Christmas. Her young friend Sarah McClure, however, takes the opposite view and decides to deck the halls brightly. As she explores the trunks packed with Bergstrom family decorations that haven't been touched in more than fifty years, Sarah discovers a curious Christmas quilt.

Albee manages to show an audience exactly what true love is and he uses a middle class WASP family with a homosexual son and a goat to do it. The end of the play has a hurt and confused wife holding forth a dripping burlap sack full of hacked up pieces of a dead goat as her husband weeps into his hands. Not only does it address the issue of how dare we define love, but Albee even is brazen enough to use a goat, which of course was the homophobic reaction to the issue of gay marriage in the first place: \"If we allow this what is next? Do we allow a person to marry a goat?\"This is ludicrous and anyone with a little common sense should see that to jump from same sex to bestiality is both crazy and propaganda. But let's play with this bit of stupidity for a moment: Imagine a young woman taking her goat home to meet the folks for the first time. \"Mom. Dad\" she says timidly, \"This is Billy.\"In 1955 there were actually Senate Congressional hearings where individuals were seriously asked about their connections with the Communist Party and asked to give names of those with whom they worked who might just be \"red\" as well. Lucille Ball, married to a Cuban, managed to escape ruin because Ball and Arnaz ran one of the most powerful studios in Hollywood. No one was hiring Lucy; she did the hiring. And no Senator was going to tell Americans not to watch the beloved Lucille Ball. Others were not so lucky and were blacklisted, never to work again. Some managed to escape. Shirley Jackson and Stanley Edgar Hyman were members of the Communist party as students at Syracuse university in the 1930'[s/. they escaped persecution but one of their very talented writer friends wasn't published until the early 70's when Woody Allen hired him as a screen writer. Ralph Ellison was published first. Arthur Miller wrote The Crucible- tightly researched and accurate (ironically, Shirley Jackson wrote a book called The Witchcraft of Salem Village but for different reasons) and America saw how the Red Scare was a witch hunt- smart America anyway.Sadly, The Crucible remains relevant as it could now go on a double bill with Albee's The Goat. One, defining the purity of love using our homophobic culture's bad taste as a well produced metaphor and the other, Miller's Witch hunt that could easily occur with anyone from the Jews in Europe to the Gays in America.To those who didn;t live in the middle of the cold war, either as the first group, who were cojlficted about siding with Germany to protect from The Communists, to the last generation who simply lkived with the fear that a series of buttons would be pushed and the world would end.\"What would you do if they droipped the bomb?\" a seven year old boy asked her grandfather who was a nuclear physcisit. He thought about bomb shelters, canned food, bottled war. His grandfather's answer scared him more than anything in his loife.\"I'd go outside and watch.\"But Miller was talking about the witch hunt of paranoia that filled the fabulous 50's. In the same time we were doing Nuclear Testing in northering Nevada and Utah while more and more countries continued to do the same and the Communist was seen as so dangerous to the fabric of life- not just American life. Arthuur Miller's point seems to have been that in retrospet the whole thing would be seen with the same foollishness as the Trials of Salem Village. It's true now, but sadly, Communists have been replaced by others of whom we are afriad: Enter Edward Albee.The other thing these plays have in common is that they both won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; the authors collected multiple Pulitzers, a plethora of Tony Awards and a production life that will go on in Regional Theatres, community theatres, colleges and High Schools for hundreds of years.And sadly, they will likely both remain relevant. Because if a German is not allowed to marry a Jew and is shot for having a relationship with one, then why can't a man be shot for having a relationship with another man? Genocide still goes on, as Paul Simon wrote in \"Old\" and Al Gore pointed out to the UN (One can use Google Earth and look down upon the vast concentration camp at Darfur Sudan) as we all stand in line at Wal-Mart on Black Friday 2012, where, according to the news, there were only three Wal-Mart handgun incidents. It takes very little and a Holocaust sneaks up on us while we're worrying about our gas bill and snow tires.My Country `tis of thee. To think about ourselves and ignore if we are free.\"}"}]}

David Frum helped make international headlines when President George W. Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union address linked international terrorists to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. But that was only one moment during a crucial time in American history, when a president, an administration, and a country were transformed. Frum worked with President Bush in the Oval Office, traveled with him aboard Air Force One, and studied him closely at meetings and events. He describes how Bush thinks\u2014what this conservative president believes about religion, race, the environment, Jews, Muslims, and America\u2019s future. Frum takes us behind the scenes of one of the most secretive administrations in recent history, with revealing portraits of Karl Rove, Karen Hughes, Condoleezza Rice, and many others. Most significant, he tells the story of the transformation of George W. Bush: how a president whose administration began in uncertainty became one of the most decisive, successful, and popular leaders of our time. Before becoming a White House speechwriter, David Frum was a highly regarded author of books and political commentary and an influential voice on the pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard. His commentary has been described by William F. Buckley as \u201cthe most refreshing ideological experience in a generation.\u201d Now, in The Right Man, we see Frum as a front-row observer and participant. Not since Peggy Noonan\u2019s account of her time in the Reagan White House has an insider portrayed a sitting president with such precision, verve, honest admiration, and insight. The Right Man will command international attention for its thoughtful account of George W. Bush in the midst of his greatest challenge.

On page 142, Bush says he is going to hold responsible not only the terrorists but the governments that aid, abet, finance and shield terrorism - does this mean Bush's good friend \"Bandar Bush\" from Saudi Arabia? Bush says \"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorist.\" I can't really blame Germany, France, Russia for turning away from us - Bush's good ole it's MY way or the HIGHWAY. All you people who follow Georgie blindly need to go back and read page 147 and tell me that he finally got his reason to invade Iraq on 9/11. \"We're finished on taxes, except maybe for capital gains - if we win the war, we'll get our recovery.\" What a great strategy! And my personal favorite was the 2 paragraphs with Tom Ridge in them. Bush made Tom Ridge head of Homeland Security because he was governor of the state that a flight 93 went down in on 9/11. What since does this make? Guess if you like Bush then it makes perfect sense but there are 48% of voters who know better! For a book that was suggested to me to see the good in George Bush, this book only highlighted the very reasons that I am so afraid of him being the President of the United States.\"}"}]}

It is skillful written and enriched with excellent stories. The concepts, though, are provocative and sometimes carried to extremes.

We try to avoid the `crowd' effect for idea generation because crowds tend towards group-think and mediocre, me-too ideas. In our view, companies need to collect a diverse selection of inputs to develop high quality concepts.The most intriguing aspect of the book is the potential to use internal 'crowds' to evaluate ideas and breakthrough concepts. Currently companies rely on small groups of senior managers to make serious and lasting judgments on concepts. Sadly, the track record of this approach is really not that good. In spite of years of `stage-gate' effort, the failure rate of new products still averages out at over 60%. There must be a better way of doing this, and this book gave me the inspiration to look at the problem in new ways.This, for me, is the best thing one can say about a book - it creates a springboard for new ideas. This is definitely one of these books and I strongly recommend you buy it, take a long Friday afternoon break in the loudest Starbucks in the neighborhood (no cell phones!), and start reading and thinking. And don't forget a pen and paper for your new thoughts.\"}"}]}

ELIOT COLLECTED POEMS 1909-1962"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"description\": \"This volume contains the works Eliot personally selected to be preserved\", \"authors\": \"['Thomas Stearns Eliot']\", \"publisher\" : \"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\", \"text\" : \"PRUFOCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONSTHE LOVESONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFOCKThis poem is a beauty. The language is so fluent that it flows lightly and evenly between our ears and its music is perfect and delightful. The images build up a crown or a wreath, according to tastes, life and death mixing equally with love and gloat. Deeply shakespearian by its syntax it is pure Chopin by its music, both rhythm and notes.THE WASTE LANDOne of T.S. Eliot's bestknown poems. What I am feeling is more an impression than a meaning. The world is old, like coming to its end, decaying. The poet sees and only sees. It is soundless and yet it is music. He brings together all sorts of recollections, experiences and small vignettes of the world, and a whole array of references to all kinds of cultures to show how the past is foregone and the future is not there. There remains only the thunder that speaks unaudible sounds of farewell on a road we cannot even see, nor follow as for that.THE HOLLOW MENIt is the end of the world, and this is nothing but a whimper because men are hollow. They do not contain anything. They are ghosts of history, so that history itself is a ghost and the world has no future. This poem is extremely and astoundingly modern indeed. NO FUTURE.ASH WEDNESDAYThis poetry is entirely dedicated to death, but also to the time between birth and death, a time of turning, a time that is felt like flying, going, flowing but there is no word, no world able to whirl any sound. Men are like living deads, already dead and moving towards death with no hope, except maybe the hope of God, but God is silent, so there is the only consolation of the Lady who is also silent and comes only after death to stare more than anything else.CHORUSES FROM THE ROCKWhere is the Life we have lost in living ? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge ? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ? These choruses are entirely dedicated to God, but with some original approach. What is important is what comes from God. God is light, but a light that is invisible and it is this invisible light that must help us never to forget that man is spirit and body, just like the Temple, and that the spirit suffers when the body suffers. And the body does suffer a lot in our mechanical times. The body is split in myriads of individuals who do not think the body as one, and society as one, and this oneness as communion with the light of God, an invisible light in a time when touching is the proof of existence.FOUR QUARTETSBy far the crowning of T.S. Eliot's poetry. The evanescent equilibrium point between a whole set of couples of antagons. The present is such a point, but demultiplied by a myriad of other couples. Past-Future, Has-been-Might-have-been, and this point is movement, constantly moving between those antagons. It gives you a vertigo, the vertigo we feel in front of the present that is a constantly moving equilibrium point. Fascinating. Men are no longer hollow but they are unstoppable motion. They are some light, fine and fuzzy moving line between all the antagons of human nature, of nature as for that. Then a long and rich metaphor of life with the sea, neverending movement that ignores past and future but is pure present and nothing else. Men and women can only worship this everlasting present motion, time and place that is no time, no place and no motion, just unstable energy burnt in its own existence.OLD POSSUM'S BOOK OF PRACTICAL CATSA set of nice and musical poems on various cats. They are enchanting and light and every rhyme is the best, each one better than all the others. A little book to be given to boys and girls who do not know yet that language is art and speaking may be a compliment to their lives.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU\"}"}]}

Will answer specific questions about book titles."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide me information about The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"description\": \"The Red Badge of Courage is a war novel by American author Stephen Crane (1871-1900). Taking place during the American Civil War, the story is about a young private of the Union Army, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a \"red badge of courage,\" to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as standard-bearer.Although Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its realism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1893, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by Century Magazine) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1982.\", \"authors\": \"['Stephen Crane']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"What can one truly say about an American Classic. It would be presumptuous on my part, at the very least, to analyze Mr. Crane's masterpiece after so many literary giants have already poked and prodded this novel of youth and war to ad nauseam. As a young boy in the early 1950s, I first read this novel and enjoyed the superficial battle narratives. Later as a college student in the 1960s, I again was treated to an analysis of this great work by a distinguished university professor. Needless to say he dug deep into the meaning of this and that and what Mr. Crane was \"really\" saying. Academia arrogance always amuses me. As I grew older, and not necessarily wiser, I grew to enjoy reading about the American Civil War more and more. Today in my 60s I guess you could say I am a Civil War buff as I have read about and visited most civil war battlefields and sites. The one thing that keeps coming back, and to me grows more interesting with each passing year, is the life and views of the common soldier. When the smoke clears away, and the generals have gone, it is the essence of the common soldier that remains. It is he, or she, that was the spirit of the battles. In this light Mr. Crane captured that elusive spirit.Today, I periodically reread The Red Badge of Courage to feel and taste what those common soldiers saw and felt. Although Mr. Crane did not actually serve in the Civil War, he was not born until 1871, his narrative nevertheless captures the flavor of those horrific times.It is a simple book about a young boy growing up during a terrible war. As the pure, innocent young boy leaves his mom and trudges off to find glory in war, he soon discovers that war is anything but glory. It is dirty, messy, bloody, lonely, and at times, most times, terrifying. He must confront his demons as the guns roar and find out who he really is. During his first encounter of battle, the boy simply runs away terrified. He agonizes over his cowardice. He longs to return to his unit but is afraid of what his mates will think of his running away. Then he is struck in the head by a rifle from another soldier and realizes he can return and claim a battle injury. So he returns and is hailed a hero. In his heart he sadly knows the truth and during a second battle redeems himself in glory. The story concludes with his realization that there is no glory in war or death and sadness. Despite this he rejoices to be among his comrades.A simple story that brings home the horrors of war and the truth of glory. Again, an American classic and a must read.\"}"}]}

And it is the subtlety with which the events are played out that make this a vintage story. I have anxiously awaited Vinge's next book since reading his masterpiece A Fire Upon the Deep. This work lacks some of the heartwarming characters that were in that masterpiece. There is still heart in this work but the overlaying theme is true grit, hard sci-fi, and incredible treachery. The enemy was never so clearly defined as the Emergents came to be. Here there were enemy's, heroes, and innocents; the usual ingredients that make Vinge's works so breathtaking, and will no doubt garner him another Hugo. Like his previous work, there is some labor involved in reading Vinge. His crafting is so subtle to be painstaking. But the effect is incredible and the conclusion well worth the labor. Vinge easily embarrasses nearly every writer in his genre while teaching writers of any genre a trick or two. I almost thought that the conclusion of this work had a Hollywood type ending. How could all these people come out of this alive? But the more I thought of this, and other more intricate parts of the novel, the more it became clear that all was thought out to every i dotted and every t crossed. The ending is probably appropriate for the amount of foreplay that went in to building it up so. I am in awe with Vinge's hand at subtlety, duplicity, and terror in its most downplayed form. I think this book had strengths in areas where his prior piece did not attempt to go too far with, yet for pure enjoyment value I think Fire was a superior piece. Both are thinking readers' stories but Deepness goes to an incredible extreme, and its vastness makes it almost a study. It's not often where you get a seamless blending of plot and character. Vinge has mastered both well. His ability to take it one step further, with both of his recent works, by making his alien characters so real, so alien, and yet, so human-like. Like his dogs in Fire, his Spiders in Deepness are compelling, interesting, fascinating, and so soulful they are endearing. Vinge has become to science fiction what Clavell is to the Asian genre: a wonderful storyteller. The question becomes, will Vinge get boring in trying to tie everything together into a collection of novels that read as one saga? Or will he just get boring? I hope not. He is much too talented to have wasted words. Can Vinge craft a third masterpiece? He is in a somewhat stilted genre. Science fiction has never shared the same respect as mainstream literature or even mystery. This is something that will work in his favor. He is less likely to become tiresome as some literary writers end up being. My only sadness is that it will be some years before Vinge has composed his next piece and sometimes that is just too long.\"}"}]}

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.\", \"authors\": \"['Thomas Hardy']\", \"publisher\" : \"Penguin\", \"text\" : \"Thomas Hardy's \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\" is, well, the story about Tess of the D'Urbervilles, a \"simple,sensuous and passionate\" peasant girl whose maturation into a woman has tremendous antipathy to its brim. The transfiguration of \"a fine and handsome\" country lass into a blooming woman with hapless consequences is the theme of this the most ambitious tragic Hardyan novel and the artistic flair of the late Victorian novelist blended with the subtle craftsmanship transcends the individual concern into one of the society.The proposition involved in \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\" first published in 1891 in three volumes has a tragic enough diction as we get it so clearly throughout the 550 or so odd pages of the book. It is to contract the unending horizon of the human life into a miniscule and apparently insignificant domain of an individual, who's inexperienced, unsophisticated, candid and uncanny. Tess Durbeyfield is a meek, submissive sixteen-and-a-half year old country girl with several siblings, a dissipated father and an illusioned mother living in the village of Marlott in the county of 19th. century fictitious Wessex,Hardy's eternal refuge from the real world outside. The chance discovery of John Durbeyfield from Parson Tringham, the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane, of his ancestral line of D'Urbervilles and a freak accidnt culminating in the death of one of his horses for which Tess herself shouldrs the blame sends the eponymous protagonist of this darkly compelling drama to find monetary solace in the wealthy Mrs. D'Urberville. As if the exploitation of the have nots in terms of financial issues weren't enough, the poor peasant girl from the poor \"blighted\" Durbeyfield family is seduced by Mrs. D'Urberville's sensual and lustful son Alec. Alec shuns her, Tess becomes pregnant, the child passes away in infancy, the unmarried mother mother starts working as a diarymaid in a farm, the Talbothays, falls in love with Angel Clare, the rector's son.....the whole flow of the tyde has a strangely familiar suspicion about itself and it's actually Thomas Hardy's exceptional gift for exploring a relatively small setting to compile a general drama of human life that transpires real tragic proportions from a fictitious figure.Art is indeed often illusory, sometimes it's even a whisper of the urge of reformation; but in more probabilities than one, art is symbolic, a sign of much deep-seated intent. The genuine accomplishment of all forms of art---be it literature, painting,sculpture,music or much else---is to portray the vastness of the human expanse in the most trimmed space and geniuses of all ages in all spheres of art have managed to do just that. Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and \"The Starry Night\" are more symbolic than cliches, Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" is the depiction of social turmoil in 19th. century Russia, Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" is a journey through a distorted and divided soul's mind and Eric Clapton's song \"Tears of Heaven\" is the ultimate homage to our passed away beloved ones. \"Tess of the D'Urbevilles\" too is a metaphor for agonies, humiliations, inward and outward strifes, twists and turns in life and the ultimatum. The unprecedented and nihilistically conspiring turn of events that Tess encounters in her hard and lonely life could've been thrown to anyone in general and any woman of any age in particular and through Tess's character as well as through the brilliant evocation of the fictional Wessex landscape and people, Hardy stags \"the ache of modernism\"in the novel.This abyss of \"the ache of modernism\" is aptly poured into the images of the rustic realm and the ascend of the morally and spiritually corrupt. Nowhere in the book is this concept clearer than in the nature of the shrewd and machiavellian Alec D'Urberville. A sinful man come to no good by demolishing an unsuspecting girl's life, Alec is also a preacher of the Gospels in his so-called reformed stage. But all his baser passions are aroused on seeing Tess after four years and he turns into a wolf once more: \"Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife, you are mine!\" This to a Tess whose innocent flaw of revealing her horrendous past to Angel on their weddind night had caused their subsequent separation and 'the deserted wife\"-'s struggle in sustaining hr livelihood. The typical male sexual desires and possessive phyche is symbolized in Angel Clare whose own sinful past is acceptable but not Tess's unconditioned misery.Throughout the novel, the bounteous description of the landscape, the environment and Nature keeps the reader spell-bound at the author's immense imaginative power, marvellous visualisation skill and abundant choice of similes and metaphors and aptly used words. Yet the language and mood always maintain a touch of pessimism and not even spares the simple, unrestrained and self-sacrificing friendship of Marian,Retty Priddle,Izz Huett and Tess.Hardy is barely good at analysing characters and that is vividly exposed towards the end of the novel. Angel returns from Brazil and scampers to rejoin with \"a cottage-girl, his young wife\" only to find her with Alec D'Urberville once again. In utter desperation of realising that she was taken in by Alec with morbid promises about her dishevelled family, Tess kills him and then elopes with Angel nly to be caught within a short span of time and be hanged. Such a sudden turnaround of events is too confusing and leaves one wondering whether more words and pages should've been devoted to such critical situations. The reader rues too the missingdescription of Tess's and Angel's marriage as much as the incomplete pictored characters' change of notions.That the end of the novel is a befitting tribute, be it poetically just, tragic or sarcastic, to the three major characters is a Jack jumping out of the box. Alec's sin is too much for this world to bear and so he dies; Tess's life is too inundated with misery, despair, responsibility and uncertainty and so she meets with a tragic end; Angel's puritan perspective finds him a pure, genteel partner in the shape of Tess's younger sister Liza-Lu.What adds jewels to the crown are the dramatic effects installed into the novel to make the reader approach the chain of events with a sigh and regret. What if Tess's written confession pushed under Angel's door hadn't gone under the carpet? Surely the tragic aftermath could've been bypassed. Again, had Tess not overheard her husband's brothers' critical approach to her, she would've surely met with her in-laws and her life would've turned over a new leaf. But tragedy is always concentrated on inevitability and waivering of the obvious and so it is in the case of Tess, the \"little fool\".The fate of an unassuming girl \"put to by an Enemy in the shape of a friend' and played from one court to another and back again like a shuttlecock isn't rare enough but what's rare is the quality of Hardy to paint a solemn picture about the essence of the issue. True, the book does often become a laboured read and provokes a deep pang of pain, anger, frustration, resentment, resentment and a rebellious intent,but the reader cannot help but fel that \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\" is \"a new kind of beauty, a beauty of tragic tone\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA\"}"}]}

But you ended up feeling like you were dealing with a saint who emerged full formed from a clam shell. How could a mere mortal follow his foot steps?Wooden on Leadership takes a revealing look at how that philosophy evolved, the mistakes he made along the way, how he corrected those mistakes and the regrets he has today. A high point for me came from seeing his notes during the years that the philosophy evolved.You still feel like you are dealing with a saint, but a saint who (like Paul when he was Saul) started out with some imperfections that you may recognize in yourself.I came to appreciate several dimensions of the Wooden philosophy that I hadn't understood before. Here is my new learning:1. Focus on helping each player become the best they can be in contributing to the team, and help the players understand how they can and are contributing to the team.2. Attract people with good values who are eager to improve in team contributions.3. Set a good example.4. There are no little things. Everything is important.I hope that anyone who ever coaches children's or school sports will read this book and be encouraged to become a better leader.

Just promise me!The most I can say in the way of analysis right now (and having just finished this story I probably shouldn't be writing this review with tears and the utter agony of human love and despair both streaming down my face) is that Tess is a classically tragic tale of what might have been but could never be. I hate to write anything so simple in the way of anyalyzing anything this vast, and there is no ONE LAYER or way of reading this story, but this to me is the overriding principle.That, at least, and the concept of what does it mean to be a pure woman/person? Clearly Tess was pure, even in light of all that had happened to her. What a fool Angel was to let such a treasure slip out of his hands, and what a hypocrite! I know I'm understanding this from an American, 21st century way of thinking, but come on, Angel?! Seriously!? You don't blame the victim for their crime, and YOU had done the same thing WILLINGLY! Blame yourself for bringing her to this end, you and the elitist group of fools you come from (author's note: I realize it's not very sound to be venting so much rage on a fictional character, especially one in a story particularly designed to make a social comment about the day in which it was written, but seriously, why didn't he just scoop her up in his arms and run away with her when he had the chance?

Well, what is history for? Never the less it is a great read,unless of course you happen to be stranded on a island or on a life boat. Enjoy every morsel.\"}"}]}

But it's not necessary to be struck down by illness, a layoff, the threat of divorce, or the loss of a loved one before we evaluate priorities and reshape life along more sane lines. Instead, the more we reshape our lives to achieve better balance now, the more immediately we can enjoy the riches life offers. Balance 20/20 helps readers find the balance they need to have enough time for everything and everyone and to enjoy life. Author George Bartko recently quit his high-paying corporate job to devote himself completely to his burgeoning business. He used the system he describes in Balance 20/20 to successfully make the transition to living his dreams. Bartko calls his system The Six Pillars of Life Balance. The six pillars are key areas that make up daily life:1. Connections (relationships)2. Mind (intellect, creative expression, and reflection)3. Motion (physical activity)4. Spirituality (a sense of connection to the universe)5. Fuel (nutrition)6. Business (personal and professional tasks) In order to balance these six pillars, Bartko recommends analyzing which of these key areas we spend too much time on--and which areas we neglect. To help, Bartko offers a quiz at the beginning of each chapter so that readers can begin to see which of the six pillars need development and which areas need less time spent on them. Bartko's advice is clear and compelling--even for those pillars that are balanced, there's room to fine-tune and improve to get the most out of our days, the most out of our lives. Balance 20/20 offers recipes to help bring balance to the fuel pillar. And Bartko's stunning photography throughout offers visual inspiration to building balance into every day..\", \"authors\": \"['George Bartko']\", \"publisher\" : \"Red Wheel\", \"text\" : \"This is one of those books that as your reading it you already know it will change your life.

Life is good for Rafael de Bourbon. The forty-year-old Spaniard recently married to a wealthy English beauty, and is days away from opening a luxury boutique hotel off the southern coast of Thailand. But when the Royal Thai Police storm the hotel and arrest him for blackmail and extortion, \"Rafa\" is thrown into Bangkok's most notorious jail. In desperation, he reaches out to the one man who can prove his innocence. Simon Riske, ex-con and now \"private spy,\" owes Rafa his life. Once he and De Bourbon were the closest of friends, until a woman came between them. Riske rushes to Bangkok to secure his friend's release and overnight, finds himself caught up in a web of intrigue larger and more dangerous than he could imagine. In hours, it is Riske who finds himself the wanted man. On the run in a foreign country, pursued by powerful unseen forces who will stop at nothing until he is killed, Riske must stay alive long enough to uncover the truth behind an international conspiracy that threatens to wreak carnage across the glittering capitals of Europe. From Bangkok to Singapore and ultimately to Cannes, Riske enlists the help of a daring investigative reporter, a rogue Mossad agent, and his own band of home-grown specialists, to thwart the cabal behind the plot, only to learn its very origins are frighteningly close to his past. Frighteningly timely, diabolically clever, and ever so stylish, The Palace is Christopher Reich's sharpest and most exciting book yet.\", \"authors\": \"['Christopher Reich']\", \"publisher\" : \"Mulholland Books\", \"text\" : \"The Palace is a historical novel featuring a vampire hero. It's the second one in a series written about this character. Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it. But for those trying to decide whether or not to read more of this genre, or whether the one vampire novel you've already read was a fluke, it may help if we have some ways to categorize these novels. Thus: BunRab's Standard Vampire Elements. First, most authors of vampire novels approach from one of the main genres of genre fiction; thus their background may be primarily in romance, or in science fiction/fantasy, or in murder mysteries, or in horror. Second, many vampire novels come in series; knowing whether this is one of a series, and where in the series it falls, may be helpful. Then we have some particular characteristics: - Is the vampire character (or characters) a &quot;good guy&quot; or a &quot;bad guy&quot;? Or are there some of each? - Are there continuing characters besides the vampire, through the series? - Are there other types of supernatural beings besides vampires? - Can the vampire stand daylight under some circumstances, or not stand daylight at all? - Does the vampire have a few other supernatural characteristics, many other supernatural characteristics, or none other than just being a vampire? (E.g., super strength, change into an animal, turn invisible) - Does the vampire have a regular job and place in society, or is being a vampire his or her entire raison d'etre? - Does the vampire literally drink blood, or is there some other (perhaps metaphorical) method of feeding? - Is sex a major plot element, a minor plot element, or nonexistent? - Is the entire vampire feeding act a metaphor for sex, part of a standard sex act, or unrelated to sex? - Is the story set in one historical period, more than one historical period, or entirely in the present day? - Does the story have elements of humor, or is it strictly serious? - Is the writing style good, or is the writing just there to manage to hold together the plot and characters?Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's series about the vampire St. Germain starts from the historical romance genre (although Yarbro is equally well known as a science fiction writer), and is a continuing series. St. Germain is definitely a good guy, using the knowledge he's gained in several thousand years of living to help others. There are a few characters that continue from book to book besides him: the women he turns into vampires, and his &quot;servant,&quot; Roger, who is a ghoul. Ghouls are the only other supernatural characters who appear in these books. St. Germain can stand daylight with the right preparations. He has unusual strength, but not limitless; unusual wisdom; and is an &quot;alchemist&quot; but there are no overt &quot;magic&quot; powers. In most of the series, he has an occupation of being an aristocrat, insofar as that was a full-time occupation through most of history; in some books he has another &quot;job&quot; as well. St. Germain does not literally drink blood; he feeds on emotions, usually during erotic experiences, but sex is nonetheless only a minor plot element, rare and very discreet. The series covers 3000 years, from ancient Egypt to the modern day; each book is set in a span of a particular period, usually 20-30 years. The writing is serious, but not self-important; the writing quality is excellent, and Yarbro's abilities as an author qualify these books as literature rather than &quot;merely&quot; genre fiction.The Palace is set in Fiorenza (Florence) in the time of the Medicis, and with a Borgia Pope in Rome. So the characters include some of the most famous people of the Italian Renaissance. Although this is only the second book written in the series, Yarbro is clearly setting up more background on St. Germain, for future novels. In this historical period, it's easy to make the Roman Catholic church a villain; the infamous Savonarola is in Florence, setting up his Bonfire of the Vanities. Warning: some torture scenes. On the other hand, there is at least a partly happy ending. One disappointment to me is that St. Germain turns a woman into a vampire in this book, and yet, as far as I can tell, she never again appears in the series, unlike Olivia Clemens. Once someone is &quot;of his blood&quot; I would expect to see them turn up as a recurring character. We can also, after all the harm he causes, count it a happy ending when Savonarola is executed. The bit players in this novel include Leonardo da Vinci - that's the kind of period it was! Good read, gorgeous descriptions of art and architecture, a lot more fun than studying the Renaissance in your Western Civ class!\"}"}]}

Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful \"monkey\"; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle \"bunny.\" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.\", \"authors\": \"['Wally Lamb']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harper\", \"text\" : \"I haven't been as stuck on a novel of this size since &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; Wally Lamb takes the reader through Dominick Birdsey's life with a talent few authors can claim. Though I did not fall in love with any of the characters, I felt pity for Thomas, the schizophrenic brother, and pity for Ray, the stepfather who &quot;did his best.&quot; For our hero, Dominick, I found myself rooting for his way out of the messes life tossed at him, and the ending of the book was not disappointing. I would recommend this book to everyone.\"}"}]}

Haar bekendste werk is Little Women, een autobiografische roman die nog twee vervolgboeken kreeg, en talloze malen bewerkt is tot toneelstukken en films.

He ogles the 16 yr old kid of his client. Hawk is a little too &quot;jive&quot; to be cool.

He's not exactly understanding of the women he meets. This is not the Spenser I love -grin-. He at LEAST is drinking Amstel Lights and Heinekens now.Susan's more annoying than helpful; his comments about her are that she told him to sip his beer and such. She still guzzles food and drink. At the end he proposes marriage and she goes &quot;Oh, jeez, I don't think so now. I just wanted you to ask&quot;. But now they're committed to each other forever even though a scant few months ago he was going for weekends with Brenda? Hmmmmm. And even though he's practically all over the woman in the story.

For those of you who have read most or all of the previous novels in the serious, you know well what that means.The war against the Imperial Order (and Jagang the Just) continues. This war has been going on for far too long in my opinion. Mr. Goodkind should have defeated Jagang in the previous book and introduced a new enemy in this one.Mr. Goodkind still writes jumbo sized books. This book, like those before it, would have been improved, not worsened, by throwing out hundreds of pages. This book could have been shortened by trimming pages which contain things which are neither interesting to the reader nor necessary to the story.Richard still has his Jekyl and Hyde act. For most of the book, he will not know how to use his awesome magics. Once again, he'll get to use them in a few crucial points, usually in the end. There is still no end in sight with regards to Richard's continuing ignorance of how to utilize his magics properly.Carried over from The Pillars of Creation, the non magical people become a major players in this book. These unique people are treated well by the author, and has become very good friends with Richard and his entourage. This is kind of strange, since these people, according to this book and Pillars of Creation, can potentially wipeout magic users in the Sword of Truth universe.As other reviewers have noted, Mr. Goodkind has been increasingly politicizing the Sword of Truth series. He has become more hawkish in politics. There's a shocking section in this book which illustrates this clearly. While I don't believe that all wars are evil as pacifists do, I am certain that some actions done by Richard in this book were very extreme. Goodkind is also quite preachy and could be very irritating for those who don't like to be preached at. Me I just tuned it out like white noise, and skipped ahead to the non-preaching parts.All the negatives of this book will not prevent me from reading the next installment in this series. I really want to see how this series ends. However, I'm not sure I'll buy the next installment. I might wait for it to appear in public libraries instead. In Chicago, that will mean a month or two after it comes out in stores. That's ok since Terry Goodkind is now off my \"Must Buy Book List\", not because of his politics, but because this series is, as it stands now, is not as fun as it used to be.\"}"}]}

I'd seen the Judy Garland film, the \"Return to Oz\" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia, though, you don't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. It's really a shame I couldn't find it earlier.Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a \"cyclone\", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, \"Tin Woodsman\" and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?It's rather different to the movie, I found. For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. It's very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. North, south, east, west... in Oz's every direction there's a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet, or how they'll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance.I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in \"Little Red Riding Hood\".All in all, a great read, I thought. Whimsical, colourful and fun. I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. Good thing there's amazon!\"}"}]}

Every day I'd commit to applying and every day would come around and I'd find some excuse not to do it. In fact, I couldn't even get myself to take action and search websites or read want ads. I wouldn't even let job hunting enter my consciousness.Realizing I had a problem, I first read Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy, by David Burns. This book seemed promising and according to the author was the #1 most recommended book on a list of 1,000 self-help titles. (I learned this in the follow-up: The Feeling Good Handbook.) Yet, every day I found excuses to avoid applying for jobs. It just seemed too painful to me to go apply for jobs I didn't want in the first place and then to get mercilessly rejected.Feeling Good and Awaken the Giant Within approach the issue of self-esteem from exactly opposite positions. Feeling Good says that you should have self-esteem no matter how little you've achieved in life. Awaken the Giant Within admits that most of us base our self-esteem on how we're perceived by others, or at least, how we think we'll be perceived by others.All I can say is the approach in Feeling Good didn't work for me.But in Chapter 3 of Awaken the Giant Within Mr. Robbins discusses the forces of pain and pleasure, and shows that everything we do is a result of our trying to avoid pain and move toward pleasure. He says that most people don't achieve what they want in life because they focus on the short-term pain, rather than the long term pleasure. And I realized that this was exactly what I was doing. I was avoiding job hunting and applying for jobs because of the pain I imagined I'd receive from being rejected. Of course, by avoiding taking action, a larger pain would be waiting for me down the road: homelessness.With a single concept, Awaken the Giant Within got me to take action, which the entire book of Feeling Good could not do.A second concept that is going to change my life is in Chapter 4: \"Belief Systems: The Power to Create and the Power to Destroy.\" The main concept in this chapter is that what you believe is irrelevant as far as its accuracy goes. (Not counting dangerous beliefs like I can heal my children with my thoughts, or I can fly if I jump off this building, of course.) What counts is whether the belief is motivating for you or not, whether the belief gets you to take positive action.For example, let's pretend I'm a wannabe writer. But I'm a little conflicted about my talents. I have doubts about whether I'll ever make it or not. Sometimes I feel like the stuff I write is great and sometimes I believe I'll never succeed. So what happens when I waffle like this is that I go for long periods without writing at all. Thus, slowing the process down incredibly, taking years to complete a single novel.But what if I changed my beliefs to: \"This book is going to be a bestseller. As soon as I complete this book, my life is going to change dramatically. As soon as I complete this book, all my dreams are going to come true.\"Of course, the odds are that it won't be a bestseller. There's a good chance it won't even sell.But, by having this positive belief, I take action. I complete the book and at a decent pace. And it either sells or it doesn't, but the belief did what it was supposed to do, it got me to take consistent, daily action. And if that book doesn't sell, then I have the same belief for the next one: \"As soon as I complete this book, my life is going to change dramatically. I can't wait to get this book written. I can't wait to get famous, etc. My life is going to be incredible.\" (Of course, keep your beliefs to yourself. Your friends will be very eager to pop your balloon. But when you keep writing books and they don't know why you're suddenly being so productive, they'll be eating their hearts out! )Basically you want to believe whatever keeps you most motivated, whatever gets you to take action. Because in reality your success is determined by your consistent, daily actions.\"}"}]}

Here is the first combat history of the war in Europe in the words of the men themselves, and perhaps the most honest and brutal account of combat possible on the printed page. For more than fifty years the individual stories that make up this narrative -- shockingly frank reflections of sacrifice and courage -- have been bottled up, buried, or circulated privately. Now, nearing the ends of their lives, our WWII soldiers have at last unburdened themselves. Beyond Valor recaptures their hidden history. A pioneering oral historian, Patrick O'Donnell used his award-winning website, The Drop Zone, to solicit oral- and \"e-histories\" from individual soldiers. Gradually, working from within the community, O'Donnell convinced some of the war's most battle-hardened soldiers to tell their stories. The result is WWII seen through the eyes of the men who saw the most intense of its action. O'Donnell focuses on the elite units of the war -- the Rangers, Airborne, and 1st Special Service Force -- troops that spearheaded the most dangerous operations and often made the difference between victory and defeat. From more than 650 interviews O'Donnell has chosen oral- and e-histories that form a seamless story line, a pointillistic history of the war in Europe from the first parachute drops in North Africa through the final battles in Germany and the long trip home. It is the story of the war not discussed in polite company. O'Donnell presents the wreckage of entire battalions nearly annihilated, invisible personal scars, and haunting revelations of wartime atrocities. But more important are the men who recount lives risked without hesitation for comrades and cause, and those who did not return: the friends who died in their arms. Their stories remind all of us that victory came only at the highest price. Remembering the infamous cliffs at Pointe-du-Hoc, bloody Omaha Beach, the bitter fighting at the Battle of the Bulge, and Hill 400 in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest, the soldiers reveal war as seen, heard, and smelled by the GIs on the front line. Also included is the unique story of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, and the trailblazing African-American \"Experimental\" Test Platoon that had to fight its own battle behind the lines. Beyond Valor captures the truths that exist among soldiers. It is one of the most inspiring accounts of the war ever produced.\", \"authors\": \"[\"Patrick K. O'Donnell\"]\", \"publisher\" : \"Simon and Schuster\", \"text\" : \"Beyond Valor is a watershed in the reporting of World War II oral histories -- i.e., the actual participants of history describe the events they participated in in their own words, free from editorial embellishment and hindsight analysis. Mr. O'Donnell diligently interviewed hundreds of American paratrooper and Ranger veterans from the European Theater of Operations in World War II. What he has assembled in Beyond Valor is a collection of personal vignettes from young Americans that describe what hell was like during the bloodiest war ever. These men take us through training, North Africa, Sicily and Italy, Normandy and Southern France, Holland and Belgium, Germany, and going back home. Unlike other war books that use only selected quotes from veterans, embellish their words and otherwise bog you down with information and details that reveal nothing new, Mr. O'Donnell lets each veteran tell his full story. In some cases, veterans for the first time ever release emotions and bitter memories that have been bottled up inside their hearts and minds for 60 years. Many of the stories are powerful and moving, even emotionally overwhelming -- like the Rangers that describe the helpless feeling of seeing their buddies get cut down by machine gun fire right next to them as they rush up to attack a German bunker. In the vein of Stephen Ambrose, Patrick O'Donnell has put together an easy-to-read book with helpful maps that goes deep into the heart of combat as seen from America's living heroes. This book -- a tribute to the greatest generation -- is a definite keeper.\"}"}]}

This beautifully written novel of American history tells the story of two families\u2014one black, one white\u2014swept up in a maelstrom of revolutionaries and anarchists, immigrants and ward bosses, Brahmins and ordinary citizens, all engaged in a battle for survival and power at the end of World War I.\", \"authors\": \"['Dennis Lehane']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harper Collins\", \"text\" : \"The author has given us a rich tapestry of historical fiction that is both true to the period in which it is set and resonant of the present age.Set in Boston in the last years of the second decade of the twentieth century, the novel begins with a public health crisis: an H1N1 influenza epidemic that sneaks ashore from returning troop carriers and soon reaches pandemic proportions. Across the country, bodies soon litter the sreets as millions succumb. In Boston, the police help keep order amidst the crisis but when one of their number is permanently disabled as a result, he is out of the force with no job and no pension. The terrible wages and unsanitary working conditions of the police force are patronizingly overlooked by politicians, leading the patrolmen to attempt to bargain collectively. But they are severely hampered in doing so by the absence of laws to protect these rights (shades of Wisconsin circa 2011!). Also working against them is an anti-immigrant hysteria that confounds labor unionism with bolshevism, anarchism and terrorism. Yes, terrorists are at work in the streets of America, carrying out bombings and assassinations. A new office of the federal government, the Bureau of Investigation, is being organized to root out the extremists from beyond our shores, and Boston is one of the major cities that comes under focus.The first-wave immigrants who run the town -- Hybernians for the most part --are unflatteringly portrayed as self-interested oppressors and turncoats to the working classes from which they ascended. Petty, arrogant and thoughly racist, they plot to maintain their hold on power in a city that is wrought with the turmoil that accompanies change.All this makes for a fascinating backdrop for human stories of the central characters: a family with one foot planted in the old ways and the other in the new, and a black man struggling to develop wisdom, maturity and strength in a culture that calls him and considers him a \"boy\". The old must yield to the new, and it does, but the painfulness as well as the hope born of change gives the novel a power and edge that at times overwhelms the reader.The craftsmanship of the novel shines throughout. The characters are beautifully defined, their thoughts and actions painstakingly imagined and conveyed. The writing is deft and adept, full of rich description and wonderful dialogue. I found myself pausing at times to read passages aloud to savor the fine use of language.In all, I was sorry to reach the end of this book; I know I'm not soon likely to find another that will give me the same pleasure and satisfaction. I recommend it heartily. How it escaped without a National Book Award is a mystery to me.\"}"}]}

Maybe not the best general or the easiest one to deal with, he stands head and shoulders above many of his peers. This is an excellent military biography of General Price during the Civil War and while over uses is a \"warts and all\" story. The author pulls no punches in saying where Price was wrong and where he was ill served by superiors and peers. Very even handed, it is clear that price had many admirable qualities coupled with some quirks but he did care and he did try his best.A second plus of this book is the excellent introduction to the war in the West. Price was at almost all the important battles and each is covered. The overview of his 1864 Missouri Campaign and almost unique, most histories do not mention it. Price usually disappears after Corinth but here we follow him to the Trans-Mississippi and defeat.Castel's appraisal of Price is very fair and worth the price of the book. Couple with the battle histories this is an excellent buy. The maps are sufficient for the book and tend to be at the campaign level. However, I did not find that to be a problem when reading about any of the battles. The writing is crisp, to the point and moves. Overall, this excellent book will increase your knowledge of the war in the West and needs to be in your Civil War library.\"}"}]}

I simply did not have the time to wait for her product to come in throught the mail. I needed something RIGHT NOW! So, I went into Sally's and asked for a good protien conditioner for black hair as well as a good shampoo for dry damaged hair. They recommended Aphogee shampoo and ION conditioner, both of these have done an excellent job on our hair. I am very pleased! My daughters hair is so healthy and shiny. So in saying this, it is my observation that her approach to taking care of our hair is right on the money. I have yet to try her products (which I am sure work fine), but right now, I'm gonna keep going to Sally's. Hey Cathy, get your products over to Sally's Beauty Supply, then I will definately buy!!

After more than a dozen moves in twenty-five years of marriage, Joanna Harrison is lonely and tired of being a corporate wife. Her children are grown and gone, her husband is more married to his job than to her, and now they're about to pack up once more. Panicked at the thought of having to start all over again, Joanna commits the first irresponsible act of her life. She runs away to Pawleys Island, South Carolina, a place she's been to just once. She finds a job as a live-in companion to Grace Finelli, a widow who has come to the island to fulfill a girlhood dream. Together the two women embark on the most difficult journey of their lives: Joanna struggling for independence, roots, and a future of her own, as her family tugs at her from afar; and Grace, choosing to live the remainder of her life for herself alone, knowing she may never see her children again. Entwined is Paul Harrison's story as he loses his wife, his job, and everything that defines him as a man. He takes off on his own journey out west, searching for the answers to all that has gone wrong in his life. One thing remains constant: He wants his wife back. Joanna, however, is moving farther away from her old life as she joins a group dedicated to rescuing endangered loggerhead turtles, led by a charismatic fisherman unlike anyone she's ever met. The Richest Season is a stunning debut about three very different people, each changing their lives when such transformations are usually long over.

W. Norton & Company\", \"text\" : \"I had heard of this book, of course; had wanted to read it for years, so when this 20th anniversary edition came out, I decided to give it a go. I had a pre-conceived notion: OK, this is going to be a really interesting biography of Ted Bundy, with the added attraction of having been written by a former dear friend. Fast, easy crime reading, I thought.I was wrong. This story is so chilling, so frightening, it grips you in the gut. Ann Rule has simply stated the facts. No sensationalism, no gratuitous gore, no psychobabble. Just the facts. As they happend. And even though the reader might think of Ted Bundy as &quot;old news,&quot; and even though he was executed in 1989, this book makes one check to see that the doors and windows are locked.There are actually two stories here: one describes the gradual disintegration of a seemingly normal, affable, brilliant man into a sexual psychopath so evil, so methodical in his vicious killings, that one wonders if he was at all human. The other story is that of Ann Rule herself, a decent, hard-working, middle-aged mother of four who meets and befriends a nice young man working beside her in a crisis clinic. A man she regards as a younger brother; a man she views as a close and trusted friend. The slow but inexorable realization on Rule's part that this man is in fact an unspeakably violent serial killer is as painful to read as it was for her to experience.Each victim is described in terms of such respect and such anguish that even a family member, I think, can feel that his or her daughter has been given a chance to shine, a chance to be more than a victim, more than a nameless number (8th girl killed, and so forth). The poignancy of these girls' very human preoccupations and lives serves to outline the contrasting horror in even more detail. That is why Rule does not have to defile the victims with intricate detail. The contrast between their young lives and their terrible deaths is enough in itself.Rule's new Afterward, written in 2000, is fascinating. She has not &quot;recovered and moved on&quot;; there is no real &quot;closure.&quot; She has come to accept that the incomprehensible contrast between Ted the Dear Friend and Ted the Monster will never leave her, and will never be fully explained, no matter how many facts she sifts, no matter how much progress has been made in understanding the sexual psychopath. It is her fate to have known Bundy in all his skins; it is our privilege to read her account of it.\"}"}]}

If you are even considering purchasing this book, then you are on the right track. I would, however, like to add a few comments about this particular edition.I was somewhat confused because one reviewer stated the book was only in English, although the book claims to be a bilingual edition. I purchased it anyway due to the difficutly in general of finding some Spanish language literature in this country, and even on this site, with the intention to return it if it was only in English. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it was indeed a bilingual edition. The cover art is quite different on the copy I received - just an observation.If you are buying this book for the original Spanish version, then I can highly recommend this book. However, I must agree with several other reviewers as to the quality of the English translation. Honestly, and I hate to say it, but it is terrible. I realize that translating great poetry is a formidable task, and that certain license may need to be taken, but I have many other bilingual poetry editions (in several other languages as well) where the English versions are faithful to the original and yet beautiful in their own right, and where I have even felt occasionally that a reading of the English version can actually enhance the overall experience of the poem. This is definitely not the case with this translation. After reading the Spanish, I would find myself peeking over at the English, and thinking to myself, \"What on earth was Tarn thinking?\" Some of the liberties Tarn has taken... At one point, I seriously felt like taking a Sharpie to the English versions to obliterate them entirely. Realizing that this was probably a little extreme, and would certainly destroy the Spanish poetry on the other side of the paper, I have settled on making copies of the Spanish versions and putting them in a notebook so as to avoid the English versions entirely. I realize this may sound extreme, but only if you have not read the translations. Even if your Spanish is intermediate, you would probably be better off with this book (or a Spanish only version if you can find one) and a good dictionary.All of that having been said, the introduction is adequate. And, of course, Neruda is remarkable.\"}"}]}

For instance, the degeneration of Rachel's relationship with Mitchell Geary was told rather than shown. We never quite see what the problem is, other than Rachel's having difficulty with the fact that people are rarely so perfect as their dreams would have them. Galilee was sketchily drawn. It is stated near the end that his only obligation to the Geary's was to be the solacing (and servicing) of their women. Why then, does he kill Mitchell's father? It is implied that he is somehow compelled by a promise to Cadmus' ancestor, but why should such a promise induce him to do what he finds to be revoltingly wrong? There is no reason to think that he is bound, as Pie-Oh-Pah was bound in Imajica, to the service of an unwise master. And what of the fact that he has been released from the promise by the first Geary woman that he has loved? And why the sado-masochistic nature of his further relationships with the Geary women? All-in-all, I found the narrator, Maddox, and his sisters to be the most engrossing characters in the book, far more complex than the eponymous Galilee.

Even among Andy Warhol\u2019s orbit of dramatic personas and colorful characters in the sixties and seventies, Curtis stood out. Whether done up in drag or portraying James Dean\u2014to whom he bore an uncanny resemblance\u2014he dazzled in films, plays, and cabarets. Friends fondly recall how he brought his onstage eccentricities to everyday life, holding court in the backroom of the iconic nightclub Max\u2019s Kansas City wearing tattered thirties housedresses, torn stockings, fabulous wigs, and glittering makeup. Curtis died of a drug overdose in 1985, but not before leaving an indelible mark on New York City\u2019s underground art scene. More than just a performer, Curtis translated his fixation on fame and its trappings into his own poetry and outrageous plays, such as Glamour, Glory and Gold and Vain Victory. With snippets of his work alongside colorful recollections from his friends and acquaintances\u2014including Lily Tomlin, Michael Musto, Holly Woodlawn, Harvey Fierstein, and Paul Morrissey\u2014this is a fitting and touching tribute that evokes the spirited, creative energy that radiated from Jackie Curtis.\", \"authors\": \"['Craig B. Highberger']\", \"publisher\" : \"Open Road Media\", \"text\" : \"That's a quote used in the movie. And now one of my top 3 favorite quotes to be used forever after.There was so much to like about this person and movie. Jackie was a phenomenal character. She/he was iconic in the strongest sense of the word. Total belief in herself and her plan (mad though it was at times) and such charisma that all around her believed in her and themselves as much as she did. She altered paradigms.This particular subculture fascinates me to no end and it is covered well in this DVD. It's classic David and Goliath except David's gotta push it by wearing a dress. I couldn't respect that in-your-faceness more if I tried. I wish I could better convey what I mean. And it's not a movie about sexual preferences. No agenda is forced on you in any way. It's just completely unique.The fact that this is a documentary and these things really happened and these people really did exist as they did, simply adds to the magic of this movie. Of course, many of those people are still with us and told their tales within. And most of them are extremely interesting as well. It covers more than just Jackie. The world Jackie became famous in is explored in depth as well.Just as a comparison, it is like the Grateful Dead shows. Nothing like this will ever happen in this way ever again - nothing this new, different, odd, and perfect just for what it was, and it's tragic if you think you may have wanted to be part of it in some way, witness it, but didn't. And if you did, you're breathing the rare air.\"}"}]}

There are a lot of reasons for that. Laura Ingalls Wilder was a wonderful writer. She's simple and always crystal clear, but at the same time, she uses so much detail and has such a great sense of the rhythm of language that her writing is beautifully poetic and always a joy to read aloud. And the characters, of course, are among the most beautifully drawn characters in literature: the feisty Laura who has such a hard time doing what she's supposed to do, her frustratingly perfect sister Mary, her strict but kind parents. Even the animals in the book come across as interesting characters. No matter how tired I am in the evening, I always look forward to getting out Little House and reading a chapter or two.Those were the things I loved about it as a child, and still love now. But as an adult I've also come to appreciate how quintessentially American this book is. It's the kind of book that makes you think about our heritage, and makes you proud to be American. In these books, Laura and her family keep facing hardships and meeting them head on. When necessary, they pick themselves up and move on to a new place, starting from scratch. They don't expect anything from anybody, and yet they care about their community and their neighbors. You often hear the words \"pioneer spirit\" used to describe America's best values, but after you read Little House that's not an empty phrase. You, and the child you read it to, understand it in your heart.\"}"}]}

'The Future of Knowledge' works on many levels: * At the strategic level, the new tools are intangible scorecards and understanding value networks * At the tactical level, the knowledge management tools for exchanging and applying knowledge are knowledge networks and communities of practice * At the operational level, a wealth of new technologies is supporting the codification, storage and delivery of the knowledge people need to complete their routine tasks.\", \"authors\": \"['Verna Allee']\", \"publisher\" : \"Routledge\", \"text\" : \"This book again shows Verna Allee's great gift for making the complex simple and practical.

As with the films, this book is incredibly intense, complicated and action packed. But it's far more than a potential screenplay. The stories bear almost no comparison at all, the films being only loosely based on the general (brilliant) concept and main character ... and of course the dramatic opening scene of this book.The writer creates atmosphere perfectly. Where his passages are descriptive (of environment, emotion or event), he keeps it taut and relevant - enhancing without weighing down the progress of the narrative.The action scenes are visceral, super-fast and, at times, brutal. Often coldly efficient and compact, as I imagine would be the case in the incredible urgency of a desperate, adrenalin fired battle to the death. Our hero acts on instinct, using his intrinsic skills, and is often confused by and even fearful of his extraordinary abilities.The dialogue is precise and constructed in a way that feels real - although quite stiff and dated at times. This doesn't obstruct enjoyment of the book however and was probably right for the time it was written. There's an awful lot of \"My darling\" and \"My true love\" between Bourne and Marie (pretty much replaced by \"babe\" and \"hun\" now!)One point that I was curious about: on three occasions the same unusual phrase popped up from sources of completely different background. `Spoors in the forest' is used by a high class Paris fashion house owner, then a thirty year American CIA veteran, then Bourne himself. Surely such different people would have different phrases to express ... well, whatever spoors in the forest means!We're often in Bourne's head. Listening to his thoughts and internal desperate battles keeps us most definitely on his side and is a good contrast to the external action of the unfolding story.Perhaps Marie is just a little TOO cool in this crisis. As she goes from economics genius, very much grounded in the sedate academic world of economics and politics to courageously dealing with brutal international assassins, covert government teams (it seems everyone on the planet is after Bourne), gun fights, rapists and kidnappers, as well as cleaning out bullet wounds. And all in a beautiful red silk dress and high heels.It's a story of many layers and depths and hidden corners. It races ahead ... and around, and back, and across, and ahead ... at dizzying speeds. Is he good? Is he bad? Which side is he on? How many sides are there? Who is he?It's very exciting. I've no idea how much of it is feasible but who cares!

In the ingenuous ex-Private Valentin Bru, the central figure in The Sunday of Life, Queneau has created that oddity in modern fiction, the Hegelian naif. Highly self-conscious yet reasonably satisfied with his lot, imbued with the good humor inherent in the naturally wise, Valentin meets the painful nonsense of life's adventures with a slightly bewildered detachment.\", \"authors\": \"['Raymond Queneau']\", \"publisher\" : \"New Directions Publishing\", \"text\" : \"This is one of my favourite Queneau novels. Actually it's one of my favourite novels! In one slim volume Queneau achieves a poignancy and oblique truthfulness that is very rarely found in 'modernist' literature. Much is said of Queneau's technique - the neologisms, anachronisms, puns, mathematics - but to focus on these surface aspects is, in my opinion, partly missing the point. Queneau puts all of himself into his works and these technical aspects reflect his deep love of language and recognition of the fact that a novel is essentially an 'artificial' creation. Why shouldn't the writer do as he pleases? But there is much more to the man Queneau. Aside from his linguistic play, his works are always deeply humane. It is enlightening to read Queneau's list of 100 favourite novels. Aswell as Jacques the Fatalist you will find Hemingway, Faulkner and Dickens. Queneau, like Calvino, considers himself a reader first, writer second. Like Calvino he considers reading itself an art form. Certainly he calls upon us to exercise our 'artistic' talents but also he requires us to see each of his novels as an 'artifact', as simply 'some writing'. A good novel can be like a window: giving us a 'view' of some created world, or focussing our attention on the 'pane of glass' itself; Queneau's novels do both. We are voyeurs of the bumbling of his characters but we can also see the frame, never forgetting that this is a novel that we're reading. And so Valentin Bru, like all his most endearing characters, is a person and an archetype. He embodies the deepest concerns of the novel (he is a naif, gifted with the &quot;good humour&quot; that means he &quot;cannot be fundamentally bad or base&quot;, encapsulating the quote by Hegel with which the novel begins) and yet we can empathise with him as a typically flawed specimen of humanity, trying to pass his time on Earth as painlessly as possible. Like Pierrot (Pierrot mon ami), like Cidrolin (The Blue Flowers), like Alfred (The Last Days). It is my belief that all these novels, all these characters, ask the same question: why do we do what it is we do? Queneau always seems to answer, never unequivocally ofcourse: because we are human. Valentin Bru does what he does because it doesn't matter what he does, he could do something else, or not. Queneau's characters and novels have no bounds, no limitations. They suggest and accept all possibilities. This is what makes his work, and The Sunday of Life especially, so profoundly and poignantly humane.\"}"}]}

I see now in reading other reviews of \"Forever Odd\" that many who loved the first book found this sequel lacking, and I can certainly understand why on many levels. Still, at first I was quite engaged as I found the main character so interesting and the setting easy to fall into. For me it was a \"first discovery\" of Odd, so even though I knew I was missing the backstory on the other characters and his earlier adventures, I was eager to keep reading.I found myself struggling to keep up my enthusiasm once the main action really kicked into gear, however. And I'm using the term \"action\" loosely as the endless pages devoted to Odd's underground tunnel journey was difficult to plod through. The burned-out hotel setting was a bit more interesting, but then we are introduced to a trio of very cartoonish villains and again my enthusiasm was waning.The main disappointment, however, was the rather ludicrous final confrontation with the main \"Big Bad\". It's a complete let-down of a Deus Ex Machina that's practically an insult to the readers who have made it so far, expecting something more dramatic and satisfying.Still, I can't rate the book too poorly as I did enjoy Odd as a character and I liked his narrative voice. I was left absolutely wanting to read more of Odd - just hopefully with some better plotting to match what such a great character deserves.\"}"}]}

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive. As his boxing becomes legendary in the city's seedy underworld, packed with wiseguys and loose women, everyone seems to want a hand in Danny's success. Robbins's colorful, fast-talking characters evoke the rough streets of Depression-era New York City. Ronnie, a prostitute ashamed of how far she's fallen and desperately in need of friendship; Sam, a slick bookie who wants to profit from Danny's boxing talent; and Nellie, a beautiful but lonely girl who refuses to believe Danny is beyond redemption -- each of whom has a different vision of Danny's future -- will help steer his rocky course.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.\", \"authors\": \"['Mark Twain']\", \"publisher\" : \"Penguin\", \"text\" : \"\"Life on the Mississippi\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \"river lore\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history.\"}"}]}

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.\", \"authors\": \"['George Orwell']\", \"publisher\" : \"epubli\", \"text\" : \"1984 is an amazing cautionary tale of what happens when the government runs amok and squelches the very people it is supposed to represent. As with any symbolic tale, readers will allow The Party- and its figurehead, Big Brother- to embody whatever agency or institution they deem oppressive, although it should not be lost that the political philosophy of 1984, or \"INGSOC,\" is a paraphrase of \"English Socialism.\" Orwell, like Ayn Rand, foresaw the bleakness of a socialism approaching its purest form, and recognized how society becomes much blander and grayer with regulation and equal rationing for everyone.For everyone, that is, except for those in charge, such as the antagonist O'Brien and the Brotherhood. The Inner Party members purposely created a caste system under the auspices of caring for those who are less fortunate or intelligent, while in reality systematically ensuring that the rich and powerful stayed that way, without threat of the lower classes revolting. The Inner Party learned from history that those in power rarely stay that way, and eventually get knocked off their pedestal by the leaner, hungrier classes below them. By creating artificial scenarios of constant war, Thought Police, and imprisoning work conditions that held no promise of improving societal conditions, the Outer Party members and \"Proles\" (from proleteriat) would always remain too tired and intimidated to rail against their surroundings. The primary aim of modern warfare, for instance, was to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.Politics aside, 1984 is a compelling action story, and I was surprised at the many racy, sexy, violent, and terrifying scenes therein, all of which kept me spellbound. Though the future predictions of Big Brother had not materialized by 1984, or (arguably) even now, this story's plot or action sequences are not one bit dated. Protagonist Winston Smith, and eventually his love interest Julia, is involved in a true rage against the machine that immediately engages the reader and summons both interest and sympathy. Surprises abound, and I had no idea until the story's end as to whether Smith would conquer the system, or end up being convinced that 2 +2 = 5.There are far too many fascinating aspects of this book to list. For one, the concept of memory eradication, and whether or not something really did happen if there is no proof to be found of its occurrence. Oceania, homeland to Winston Smith, was alternately at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia, and as soon as the enemy changed, any proof of having battled the other was immediately banished. In fact, Winston worked in the Ministry of Truth, where he and his coworkers spent their days erasing (e.g., burning papers or rewriting newspaper columns for the archives) any proof of events whose existence contravened the present philosophy- this way, (a rewritten) history would show that Big Brother never got his facts or predictions wrong.The book's language is amazing- clearly Orwell envisioned not only an entire dictionary's worth of new words, but a revolutionary new approach to speech as a device to control the thoughts of the speaker. The elimination of words which hold secondary meanings, and/or which convey independent thought, engenders a world in which people are incapable of- or not aware of the possibility of- treasonous thoughts (\"thoughtcrimes\"), let alone acts. \"Doublethink\" is the act of consciously denying reality, and making oneself believe wholeheartedly Big Brother's fictions.\"}"}]}

The back cover makes it sound like a sort of News of the Weird, circa 1880, with a scattering of interesting headlines. And everything on the back cover is in the book, and all of the short bits about cannibals and weird inventions and stock market insanity are in there... they're just crammed into about 20 pages. The vast bulk of the book, perhaps 170 out of the 290 pages, is an incredibly-overlong retelling of a murder trial from NYC in the 1880s, where a bizarre mistress apparently had a friend kill the doctor she desperately wanted to marry. She apparently staged their wedding in advance using another man as a double, went to great lengths to drive off other potential female suitors, stole his will and other documents that would have reflected poorly on her, bullied her daughters to help alibi her in the murder, and so on. It's an interesting case, but unfortunately the presentation is very lacking, and there is really no conclusion to the whole story, even after 180 pages of it.The murder and trial have all the elements of a good episode of Law and Order --unfortunately it badly needs to be edited down by at least 80 pages, and rewriting wouldn't hurt either, since so little of the evidence (the bizarre and self-defeating tactics of the prosecution, for instance) are explained with any sort of context, while every bit of unimportant minutia is poured out onto the page like a bucket of spilled blood. The author was obviously far too in love with his own material, and while he is entitled to some love based on all the tedious research he did to unearth it, the reader is entitled to a book that's been properly edited and had the fat cut from the meat.After that endless trial description, there are 10 pages of quick and fascinating bits, followed by another overlong description of the sinking of a steamship in a hurricane. That segment runs a good 90 pages, and while it's too long, it's not as greviously-boring as the doctor's murder case. The book then closes with 10 more pages of interesting weird news tidbits, all of which were fascinating and could easily have been doubled or tripled in size.This book felt like it came in about 350 pages in rough draft, the publisher ordered it down to under 300, and in his cutting Finney decided to pare down every short news item, while leaving the bloated trial story untouched. An approach that was exacty opposite the one he should have taken, in my opinion.\"}"}]}

I know Amazon lumps together all the various publishers and editions in one foul lump, thus making deciphering the reviews near impossible.This short novel is told as a story within a story. An unnamed narrator introduces us to the modern-day scene, to the setting where the story is being told, the story of this journey of the main character, Charles Marlow. Thus Marlow's first-person story (surely 95%+ of the text) is the bulk of the book and is thus in quotation marks. The trouble with this edition is that the beginning quotation marks are sometimes dropped from the text. This resulted in me thinking the narrative had gone back to the rather insignificant beginning narrator, and thus back to the present day. But no, it's still Marlow's story, just without the necessary quote marks. This happens too often.Another problem I had with this e-text is that very many paragraphs are not indented. Add that to some instances of unusual line breaks, and I often wondered whether I was reading a new paragraph at all, or still the previous one. Throw in the occasional absence of quotation marks, and again I was also sometimes wondering if Kurtz was still telling his story or if the unnamed narrator was. The story isn't a particularly easy read (to me anyway) in the best format, and if you add these annoying and confusing etext errors, it makes it even less so.This is a free production, put together by folks who only meant to make the book available for us cheapos who want it for free. It seems unfair to criticize them at all, but in this day of ebooks quickly becoming more and more the norm, I only mean to let others know that they might want to seek out another version, if one is available.

I read that book for the first time at age 21, and I can honestly say it changed my worldview - permanently, on some issues. Rich Zubaty's book, first published almost exactly 50 years later, has done the same for my perception of my sex, distorted as the image of we men has become in recent years, due to the feminist curse. And to think I once considered myself a male feminist! I like the way Mr. Zubaty refers to the female-driven desire for \"things\" as mater-ialism. It reminds me of the word coined by Mr. Wylie for the inordinate worship of motherhood in his day: Momism.Of course, one could quibble with Mr. Zubaty's book here and there: All men are not as hard-working and self-sacrificing as he suggests; all women are not as selfish and mater-ialistic. But having said that, I must reiterate that this is a man-book, written not with a fussy and literal attention to every detail, but with a burst of uncanny insights about how we've been screwed for so long, and tremendous fluidity in spelling them out. Damn funny in places, too.A final, personal comment. Mr. Zubaty, I served three yearsin the U.S. Army, and since then, for the past 39 years, I've been a reporter for my hometown newspaper. In all that time, the only Zubatys I've ever encountered were two or three families right here in my own small Midwestern home. Do you have any ties to Madison, Ind.?\"}"}]}

First appearing in 1970, it still has some of the sexist tones of the original series that were quickly phased out in later Star Trek incarnations.The premise is that the Klingons have attacked the Federation and they have somehow rendered the Organians powerless. At the time of the attack, the Enterprise finds the entire Klingon empire between them and the border between the Federation and Klingon space. Kirk quickly decides that their best option is to try to make contact with the Organians and determine why they have not intervened. Since it is too risky to cross so much Klingon space to reach the Organian planet, the plan is to beam Spock all the way to Organia on a long range transport. He is selected because he has met them, is the most capable to reason with them and Captain Kirk cannot leave the ship at a time of war.The beaming strategy fails and suddenly there are two Spocks, both of which claims to be the original. Each retains the impeccable logic of the original and convincingly argues that they are the original and the other is the imposter. One is in fact a danger to the ship and Kirk and the remaining crew needs to be on guard. Eventually, the problem is solved and the Organians intervene to stop the war.To me, the highlight of the book is McCoy's musings that the transporter commits murder each time it is used for the first time on a human. While there are holes in his arguments, the intelligent responses of Spock and Scotty make the book well worth reading. Such debates about the impact of technology on humans would have been widespread as the technology that was so much a part of Star Trek was developed. The debate also demonstrates that McCoy's abhorrence of technology is founded on intellect rather than base irrationality.\"}"}]}

Pullman-as any good writer will do- keeps readers guessing until the very end. Everything is resolved, though often not as some readers would like it to be.

Just goes to show how differently a work of art can hit different people!The Red Lamp is definitely that...a work of art. I've read all of Mary Roberts Rinehart's mysteries, but it is this one - The Red Lamp - that I most frequently pull off the shelf for a fourth or fifth reading.This book is a little creepier than many of the other Rinehart mysteries; it has a subtle undercurrent of the supernatural running through it. The characters are very vivid (especially that of the narrator) and the book manages to make a number of philosophical observations that remain profoundly relevant today.As to the plot, the mystery itself is top-notch, and the killer's motivation one of the most unusual and disturbing I have seen in any &quot;golden age&quot; mystery. This book's overall style reminds my very much of that extremely popular ghost novel of the early 1940s: &quot;The Uninvited&quot; by Dorothy Macardle.To compare the style and plot devices of The Red Lamp to more modern works, I would say it is also similar in structure and tone to those supernatural mysteries written by Barbara Michaels from the 1960s - 1990s (which still remain popular today).I'll close this review with a bit of trivia. While The Red Lamp does not depend on a supernatural killer, it does end with some of its inexplicable events purposely left unexplained. Upon reading the author's autobiography, I learned that she had some genuinely weird experiences, in a summer home she briefly occupied, and these became a partial inspiration for The Red Lamp.\"}"}]}

The letters are written by Matthew Bramble, the family head; Tabitha Bramble, his increasingly desperate unmarried sister; Winifred Jenkins, Tabitha Bramble's servant; Jery Melford, Matthew's Oxford educated nephew; and Lydia Melford, the lovestruck niece who most unfortunately fell for an actor.The novel is rich and has many layers. The travels afford Smollet a fine device for social satire and observation. Smollet is best-known for his satiric writing, and he does have a serious bite. The way that he skewers the spas at Bath or (more gently) teases the English for their prejudices about Scotland are classic moments and very funny.I think that in all the focus on the satire, however, something gets forgotten about the genuine warmth for the characters. I had been a little bit hesitant about reading Smollett in the past because of his legendary satiric harshness in books like Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle. I only picked this up after reading an article on Smollet which opined that Humphrey Clinker was a much more mature novel than the early works-- not so much a picaresque satire and more of a full novel which functions on many levels. For all that Smollet does not gloss over the faults of his characters, there is still the feeling that he treats them with affection. It is difficult not to read Smollet into the character of Matthew Bramble. The grumpy gout-ridden old man who takes issue with nearly everything is eventually capable of some very genuine acts of kindness.I also thought that it was worth mentioning that the book is very readable. It is easy to be frightened off by the 18th century-ness of it all. I read an unedited edition without notes, and had no trouble following the prose. I had to look a few words up and spend a little more time on some of the sections, but it still was relatively easy to read. I found that I did not mind spending more time with the book-- each letter was a rich source of observation, double entendres, warmth and humor.I would recommend this book to all readers, not just the student of the 18th century novel. Particularly if you are a fan of writers like Dickens you may enjoy stretching your time period a little bit and picking up The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker.\"}"}]}

I have recently reread this book for the 13th time. I can't count the number of passages where I felt exactly the same way about a director, a costumer, a choreographer. I thought I was alone with these impressions. Her words provide great comfort when I remember my own experiences.Many of her assertions regarding the idolatry of Balanchine and Baryshnikov vs. who they might have been underneath their &quot;genius&quot; touches on one simple fact: they were still human, and thus, flawed. Dance, which dies instantly, is supposedly ethereal and perfectionistic. In reality, it is a punishing art, and takes much mental and emotional focus to deal with the fleeting splendor one achieves while onstage. Her unflinching honesty, revealed from the eye of the studio and not so much the stage, came from a great struggle throughout her parents' uneasy marriage, her alcoholic father, and the struggles of anorexia and drug addiction, appears in passage after passage. When you have delved through the lower depths, you find the words to articulate the feelings all these previous things have denied. It's as if all the physical anguish finally pushed the right words out to describe her experience. I'm sure she made more than a few enemies by revealing all, but in the end, we all have to live with ourselves. We may never know another person as intimately as we know ourselves. She wished to please everyone by being something other than herself. In the end, to paraphrase from her book, she found who she was by seeing what she was not. Out of all the Balanchine dancers who've written autobiographies, Gelsey's and Toni Bentley's &quot;Winter Season&quot; stand out. Both of these dancers seek the truth, and with this, they found themselves. An excellent, stunning read. I adore this book.\"}"}]}

I suspect he did so to emulate Ernest Hemingway, his hero, when he went off to the Spanish Civil War which served as grist for his novels. In other words, the Marines and the Pacific war were to be the material for Leckie's great war novel. This memoir is as close to a great novel as he got. In reading his novel/memoir you learn a lot about Leckie, his disdain for all authority that didn't recognize his brilliance which means almost every officer he encountered, his penchant for stealing stuff and going AWOL which landed him in the Brig on a regular basis. Something he learned to be pround of. He also was involved in some battles but what you learn of them has mostly to do with how it impacted on Leckie. Oh yes, Leckie was also a great lover, a big time drinker and, as mentioned earlier, a serial thief. As far as recommending it, if you aren't put off by his penchant for referring to officer's statements as \"ejaculations\" then it serves as a bookend to Sledge's classic, \"With the Old Breed\", in that it presents the views of a misfit Marine to the honorable and compelling account of Sledge's experience as a Marine.\"}"}]}

It describes the loss of good friends, the fear and fog of war, the &quot;shakes&quot; just before the fight and the long periods of self-doubt after. It also asks the fundamental questions: have we taken our freedom too lightly? Is citizenship without sacrifice a good thing? C.S. Lewis once said, &quot;We laugh at honor, and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.&quot; In this post 9/11 world, these questions, and many others, are well worth pondering again. I've read no novel that asks them quite as bluntly, as effectively, or as entertainingly as Starship Troopers.\"}"}]}

He basically does all of the things that we do in our down time (those that have jobs) read, sleep, watch tv, visit with friends, work out, go out to eat, and so on. He didn't find anything wrong with it really, and he understands that women may not always be that attracted to him because of the lack of ambition he carries, whether or not he is a good looking man.He stumbles upon a single mom who feels that she does not have enough to offer him, and realizes that he has struck gold. They (single moms) are this hidden resource that he never knew existed! He doesn't have to spend every waking moment with them (because they have less time) great sex, and he looks like this good guy because he thinks it's hard for them to find men to date that will put up with the fact that they have children!He starts going to these single parent meetings S-P-A-T (Single Parents Alone Together) and tries to gain access to all of the single moms only to find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be. But, what he ends up getting out of it, is something that he never knew existed---a life. He meets Marcus, who is the son of a depressed single mom who cries almost every day. He strikes up a frienship with Marcus, who shows him that maybe it's better to give and receive, instead of just receive. He finds meaning in life when he never knew there was any.A touching book, and at times, laugh out loud funny. I'm looking forward to Hornby's next effort!\"}"}]}

Jane Eyre is the book for you. Jane Eyre follows the life of a \"plain Jane\" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, \"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a \"good child,\" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions.\"}"}]}

I have not determined if this is a problem with the recipes or with my machine, so I'll need to play around to try to solve that. My only other complaint is that many of the breads call for dairy or eggs and thus can't be used with the delay timer. I would like to see some \"breakfast\" breads that could be made overnight, but nearly all the ones in this book say they are not suitable for the delay timer.As other reviewers have mentioned, this book gives tons of background notes, information on ingredients, and information about specialty breads, such as gluten-free.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to those wanting to get the most out of their bread machine.\"}"}]}

THE KILLING was originally published under the title CLEAN BREAK.\" The book, THE KILLING (c. 1988) by Lionel White, is a tightly written 155 page 'caper' novel that combined several personal stories together leading to a slightly anti-climatic ending, all into eleven short chapters.The author, Lionel White, must be credited for originating the non-linear story telling technique he used for the interplay of several disparate characters cooperating succesfully for a two million dollar robbery of a racetrack, during a major sweepstakes race, in broad daylight.Surprisingly well written and containing an articulate but streetwise writing-style, THE KILLING is the story of thirty-six year old career criminal Johnny Clay, who conjured-up in his mind a race track robbery during his four year stint in prison for larceny, and while out on parole, placed his theory into practice. Recruiting five key 'inside' figures to pull off his heist, Johnny Clay then sub-contracted three professional hoods, outside of his amateur entourage, to perform necessary and unique diversions.Johnny Clay's inner circle included: George Peatty, a track cashier; Big Mike, race club bartender; Marvin Unger, a court stenographer with important connections; and Randy Kennan, city police officer and life-long friend of Johnny.The out-of-sequence, anti-structure idea of THE KILLING began in chapter eight, as Johnny Clay recruited Nikki, a hit man, who would shoot the lead race horse, 'Black Lightening', from a parking lot in his MG, using a 30.06 scoped rifle with silencer, and after the lot attendent brought him a program, the bit of suspense would end as Nikki drove off the lot, unharmed, mission accomplished. Then again it dropped back in time as Johnny Clay hired Tex, a thug of a boxer, who then created a diversion at the bar, drawing away several Pinkertons from the 'Private Door' Johnny must enter, by slapping the bartender, Big Mike, in the face before the shooting and then getting clubbed into submission after creating a minor disturbance. Then another retrograde instance as Johnny Clay recruited a youth named Maurice Cohen, a skinny ex-con and ex-running back, to divert the police, and whoever else would follow Johnny out the Private Door once Johnny himself completed the two million dollar cash stick-up; so Johnny could do a quick change en route and melt into a hysterical crowd caused by the horse shooting.The logical plan went like clockwork as each key inside figure played out their role: Big Mike placed a flower box containing a .45 cal Thompson Submachine gun, 'the chopper', into a locker then nonchalantly goes back to work at the bar. George Peatty also nonchalantly unlocked the Private Door from the inside, then simply went back to his ticket window, his small but important part completed. Then Johnny entered the opened Private Door unnoticed during Tex's barroom brawl, ran upstairs to the employees locker room, took the flower box out and into a toilet stall, assembled and loaded the tommy gun, then put on gloves and tied a handkerchief around his face, ran upstairs to the money office, pointed the 'chopper' at several armed guards, clerks, and secretaries; had them stuff two million dollars of the track's winnings into a green duffel bag he provided. Johnny then backed out and locked the door, dropping the tommy gun on the floor and throwing the duffel bag out the window without hesitating an instant, then bolted down the stairs and out the Private Door disappearing into the mayhem he had created. Police officer Randy Kennan, in uniform, waiting outside the office building, then picked up the discarded duffel bag and tossed it into his police car, then quietly drove away. A well drawn map of the entire race track indicating each position of the participants is conveniently included on page forty-six of THE KILLING.The author further included some simple subplots in THE KILLING as the motivations for each amateur participant in the robbery are revealed, most notably George Peatty. Mr. Peatty's shrew wife, Sherry, instigated her own plots and schemes when her lovelorn husband bragged to her about the upcoming robbery. She then engaged her ruthless gangster boyfriend, Val, into a plot to hijack their booty after the robbery.Things go wrong as Sherry had a sexual affair with police officer Randy Kennan enticing her husband's jealousy; then her boyfriend Val beats her half to death to extract the location of the meeting place for after the robbery. Getting this information, Val and his hoods burst into the apartment where all the inside gang are waiting for the return of Johnny Clay with the money. The lights go off as gunfire breaks out and several members are shot, including George Peatty, who escaped mortally wounded out a window, down a fire escape, with a revolver in his pocket.The ending of this interesting story on page 155 took place in LaGuardia Airport as the wounded and dazed George saw Johnny Clay with two suitcases full of money thinks he is cutting out and mistook Johnny's girlfriend, Fay, for his own wife, shot Johnny Clay several times in the stomach, in a fit of rage and jealousy.The book THE KILLING by Lionel White, was well written and easy to read in a single evening. It contained the unique \"axis of time\" non-linear story telling technique which took a simple & straightforward robbery plot,turning it into an interesting drama, with its \"anti-structure\" idea also transformed the work into a fascinating and compelling crime novel. It was no wonder that director Stanley Kubrick chose the work of Lionel White to base his 1956 movie 'THE KILLNG' .\"}"}]}

All the Surrealist stars and their most important works are here--Aragon, Borges, Breton, Bu\u00f1uel, Cocteau, Crevel, Dal\u00ed, Desnos, Ernst, Man Ray, Soupault, and many more--for all of whom Durozoi has provided brief biographical notes in addition to featuring them in the main text.\", \"authors\": \"['G\u00e9rard Durozoi']\", \"publisher\" : \"Taylor & Francis US\", \"text\" : \"This work is the definitive word on surrealism. All bases are covered, from the history of the movement to the methods behind it; the artists, culture, and times. If you know a little about the art movement, SURREALISM, this will further your knowledge by far - and if you're relatively new to the subject DON'T WORRY...! This piece is all you'll ever need to speak proficiently on the subject of surrealism.\"}"}]}

Weapons of Choice is, on the most superficial level, the technogeek's dream of 21st century superweapons meeting WWII technology, but it promises and delivers so much more; Birmingham explores the social dislocation of a generation inured to total war finding themselves in an environment where their social and military organisation is viewed as alien and threatening.Birmingham's WWII setting is still within living memory, and the near future he postulates for his cast of displaced persons from 2021 is entirely plausible, yet the characters from each of these periods view one another as almost another species. We stand between them and observe their interaction, and can empathise with both groups.John Birmingham has struck Alternative History gold with Weapons of Choice.

When All Things Bright and Beautiful was published three years ago, it became the number one best seller in the world, winning still new friends for the Yorkshire veterinarian whose first book All Creatures Great and Small had already been enjoyed by millions of readers. In this, his third book, he takes up where he left off-- both in terms of the warmth, humor, and skill with which he writes, and in the story itself. It is World War Two and James has just been inducted into the RAF. We see him at training camp and we go back to Yorkshire-- on real trips as he breaks away to see Helen who is about to have a baby, and on trips of reverie as he recalls the Dales, the animals, and the Yorkshire people who have so enriched his life. We meet old friends again-- his partner Siegfried, the zany Tristan, the bon vivant Granville Bennett-- and scores of new folk, each with a story to tell. James Herriot is back, and, as one reviewer said of his work, \"If ever you have loved a friend, human or otherwise, this is the book for you.\"\", \"authors\": \"['James Herriot']\", \"publisher\" : \"Bantam\", \"text\" : \"\"Two hours and yards of catgut later, we dusted the patched up peritoneal surface with sulphanilamide and pushed the entire mass back into the abdomen.

As always, Herriot presents us with a lifestyle that we can all envy, despite his self-deprecating asides. He paints a graphic, lovely, and seemingly true-to-life portrait of life in the Scottish Dales.Herriot is at his best when describing visits to local farms when he does hands-on work under the watchful eyes of the farmers. Their stoicism is always amusing, and the technical details of the veterinary practice of the time are always fascinating. I found the RAF adventures to be a little less engaging, but the book is well worth reading.Highlights of this book include a depressed man whose dog, Digger, starts to go blind; a sick farmer whose calf has severe stomach problems; and the care of a horribly wounded stray cat that turns out to be rather remarkable.I didn't read these books in order, and now I wish I had. You can really enjoy all of the stories without any background, but you can probably enjoy Herriot's life a little more if you see him go from newly appointed apprentice to respected top doctor.\"}"}]}

The exchange is lively and at times intense as these two articulate men wrestle over what the Scriptures tell us about God's sovereignty and man's free will. This thought-provoking, challenging book provides potent responses to the most frequently asked questions about Calvinism. Is God free to love anyone He wants? Do you have any choice in your own salvation? It\u2019s time to find out. Calvinism has been a topic of intense discussion for centuries. In this lively debate, two passionate thinkers take opposing sides, providing valuable responses to the most frequently asked questions about Calvinism. Only you can decide where you stand on questions that determine how you think about your salvation. Story Behind the Book The subject of Calvinism has been hotly debated for many years, and now two prominent authors and researchers will debate this controversial topic in a book debate. This project came about when Mr. Hunt wrote What Love is This- Calvinism\u2019s Misrepresentation of God.

Dave Hunt simply refuses to confront most of the points raised by White, thus leaving him at times with material that is plainly filler material, since the points he raised were answered so thoroughly. His rhetoric is shrill while unsubstantiated, and interaction simply doesn't exist. I simply can't say enough about how badly Hunt performs in this book, which didn't come as a total surprise, either, to be honest. He simply isn't even in a minor league system of the league Dr. White plays in, so a lopsided result had to be expected.As for White's performance, it was okay, but not spectacular. He misunderstood Hunt's points on two or three occasions, which disappointed me; he's better than that. I am rather surprised that White just assumes that dispensationalist history is Arminian in bias, and doesn't even begin to point out the staunchly Calvinistic disposition of early dispensationalism, or even how a dispensationalist system DEMANDS credence in an eternal decree. James White is one of my favourite authors, but he has a long way to go in interacting with dispensationalists, not only for the purpose of disbelieving the system, but also for building bridges to further the cause of the doctrines of grace.\"}"}]}

Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty.\u201d - E.M. Forster, Howards End Howards End is an estate with a rich history and cultural heritage cherished by the Wilcoxes, a rich family with traditional ideas. However, the half-German Schlegeles \u2013 the new aristocracy \u2013 are not that impressed, yet Ruth Wilcox sees Margaret Schlegel as the ideal owner. That\u2019s why on deathbed, Ruth leaves the house to Margaret in written note. The note is burnt by the husband Henry who grows fonder of Margaret with each passing day. Is Margaret bound to Howards End? And what does all of this have to do with the struggling Basts? Xist Publishing is a digital-first publisher. Xist Publishing creates books for the touchscreen generation and is dedicated to helping everyone develop a lifetime love of reading, no matter what form it takes\", \"authors\": \"['E.M. Forster']\", \"publisher\" : \"Xist Publishing\", \"text\" : \"In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \"lower\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate. When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\"Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \"below him\" who are dependent upon his whims. When Henry asserts that Porphyria Fire Insurance Co. is on the verge of collapse, Helen and Margaret persuade Leonard Bast, a young clerk they have befriended, to resign his position there, only to have him later \"downsized\" out of his subsequent bank job. Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on those over whom they have little control. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success. When Helen returns from Germany, where she has been living, and Henry and his family discover she is pregnant, Henry's belief that her condition reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm of the country and that its conflicts are those of the nation. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years. Mary Whipple\"}"}]}

Don't get me wrong, I love dogs (heck, I wrote `The Basenji Revelation' after all) and sometimes I wonder what they feel, think and dream.

Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg.

Philosophy and theology. 660A)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"description\": \"nan\", \"authors\": \"nan\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"It is not difficult to portray Rousseau's ideas as authoritarian or totalitarian. He denied citizenship to women (though this was normal for thinkers of his age). He used language such as\" forced to be free\" and \"trained to bear with docility the yoke of the public happiness\". The Censorial Tribunal and the insistence on a civil religion seem illiberal to the modern mind. He argued that monarchy (single ruler) is best in large states, and elsewhere aristocracy (preferably elective) is generally best because democratic governments often suffer internal strife: \"If there were a nation of Gods, it would govern itself democratically. A government so perfect is not suited to men.\" He requires citizens to cede all rights to the community, whereas modern democracies invariably stress rights. Finally, Rousseau condemns representative government and dislikes political parties and pressure groups, for they tend to create mini general wills that make it difficult for the General Will to emerge.Some of these points can be countered more or less successfully. On the question of language Rousseau is employing rhetorical flourish. On democratic government, Rousseau's preference for aristocracy is not all-important because the democratic elements of his theory concern the sovereignty of the people, not the form of government. On pressure groups and political parties, Rousseau wishes to discourage rather than ban them, and Rousseau has certainly not been the only critic of representative government.In what ways is Rousseau's thought democratic? The elements are consent, participation and majorities. Locke had postulated consent in the Social Contract and \"tacit\" consent thereafter, but for Rousseau consent requires all (male) citizens to meet regularly to determine the laws, for only thus could a general will emerge through which men find true freedom. Though this direct democracy is impractical in modern states (too large), the concept of participation won many supporters in the second half of the 20th century who argued that modern representative government provides inadequate opportunities for participation. The claim that people - all the people - must be the author of the laws is Rousseau's greatest claim to be a democrat. Others were later to assert that a \"general will\" existed in society without reference to a popular assembly, and Rousseau would have had no truck with that.One idea that makes Rousseau seem very modern is his claim that freedom requires sufficient economic equality for no man to be dependent on another: that freedom and equality are inseparable. Not all modern democrats follow Rousseau in emphasising equality but an important group does.Of the arguments for seeing Rousseau as authoritarian or totalitarian the most important is the extent to which Rousseau assumes each man's interest are synonymous with the common good. Rousseau says men must vote in the assembly on what they believe to be the general will and if in a minority should tell themselves they were \"mistaken\" rather than simply on the losing side. It is true that Rousseau constantly reminds us he is writing of small and homogeneous states, but even in the smallest states there are surely greater differences of wants than Rousseau supposes, and greater differences of opinion as to what constitutes justice.The key feature of an authoritarian state is that decisions are made by a minority without majority participation in the previous discussions. The tools considered necessary by modern liberal democrats for \"participation\" and \"discussion\" are missing in Rousseau, for he discourages interest groups and political parties. However, the reason they are missing is because he insists on popular sovereignty, with the participation of all citizens in making the laws to establish a \"general will\". On the other hand, it is in this concept that elements of totalitarian democracy appear. Pluralist democrats assume men differ and that politics is the resolving of conflict between them. Rousseau assumes that politics is consensual, with a solution (a general will) waiting to be found. The word \"authoritarian\" is perhaps inappropriate, but his collectivism surely has totalitarian overtones. Yet Rousseau is perhaps more democrat than totalitarian by modern standards, arguing as he does that \"each citizen should come to his own opinion.\" I don't think Stalin, Hitler or Mao ever said that.\"}"}]}

Since his mysterious death in 1971, millions more fans from a new generation have embraced his legacy, as layers of myth have gathered to enshroud the life, career, and true character of the man who was James Douglas Morrison. In Jim Morrison, critically acclaimed journalist Stephen Davis, author of Hammer of the Gods, unmasks Morrison\u2019s constructed personas of the Lizard King and Mr. Mojo Risin\u2019 to reveal a man of fierce intelligence whose own destructive tendencies both fueled his creative ambitions and brought about his downfall. Gathered from dozens of original interviews and investigations of Morrison\u2019s personal journals, Davis has assembled a vivid portrait of a misunderstood genius, tracing the arc of Morrison\u2019s life from his troubled youth to his international stardom, when his drug and alcohol binges, tumultuous sexual affairs, and fractious personal relationships reached a frenzied peak. For the first time, Davis is able to reconstruct Morrison\u2019s last days in Paris to solve one of the greatest mysteries in music history in a shocking final chapter. Compelling and harrowing, intimate and revelatory, Jim Morrison is the definitive biography of the rock idol in snakeskin and leather who defined the 1960s.\", \"authors\": \"['Stephen Davis']\", \"publisher\" : \"Penguin\", \"text\" : \"Even though I'd forgotten most of what I read about Jim Morrison in the early 1990s, it all came back to me in the middle of Stephen Davis's not quite the biography-to-end-all-biographies. What I remembered is that stories about Jim Morrison's life after 1968 devolve into an endless parade of ruined concerts and alcoholic fogs. As a reader, one needs a metaphorical iron stomach to make it all the way from Venice Beach in 1965 to that bathtub in Paris to July 3, 1971.A lot of the anecdotes Davis related were familiar to me from the tabloid quality \"No-one Here Gets Out Alive\", or from the Tolstoy-length \"Break On Through\". The editing is suspect, as in \"Break On Through\": The Doors make their final appearance at the Winterland in San Francisco three times (twice in eight pages!).Davis's book takes a slightly different approach to the earlier books but essentially tells the same stories. For example, he provides less detail about the day-to-day proceedings of the Dade County obscenity trial, in favor of questioning whether or not the presiding judge was on Richard Nixon's payroll. And where \"No-one\" spent a lot of time postulating that Morrison was still alive, and \"Break On Through\" revealed that (gasp!) Morrison may have died of a heroin overdose (gasp!), \"Jim Morrison\" is the book that actually walks the reader through his final days in Paris and constructs a credible timeline. Davis builds up the false hope of Morrison's escape from the public eye, and then shows how ill-used he was even in death.I found it interesting that the book carefully details as fact, scenes from the Oliver Stone movie which Stone himself admitted he'd made up in order to illustrate a general point, such as the exchange with Andy Warhol about the gold-plated telephone. On the other hand, I quite liked Davis's efficient debunking of the Lizard Queen. While the book's lack of attributions (and an index!) is annoying, I don't doubt that Davis did a comprehensive job on the research, and I don't doubt that he chose his sides very carefully. In general, the research is well documented. The passages from Morrison's journals, especially the ones written in Paris, are revealing, as is the June 1971 photo of Morrison showing him to weigh nearly 300 pounds.Lengthy asides into social history may have been superfluous, perhaps, in that all those '60s stories have been told before. But those same oft-told tales are essential for putting not only Jim Morrison in context, but the rest of his bandmates as well. The father of the man who wrote \"The Unknown Soldier\" was a player at the Gulf of Tonkin; the epochal sound produced by Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore came directly from their immersion in the TM and Eastern religion then in vogue.In the end, the length of Davis's book is justified, even though it takes as long to read about the troubled making of the \"Waiting For The Sun\" and \"Soft Parade\" albums as it must have taken to produce them.\"}"}]}

Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \"dramatic style\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \"reading\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \"Cyclops\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \"Nausicaa\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.Mark Twain remarked \"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses.(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction.\"}"}]}

His masterly overview of the history of the French Revolution has taken its rightful place as the definitive account. A vivid narrative of events in France and across Europe is combined with acute insights into the underlying forces that created the dynamics of the revolution, as well as the personalities responsible for day-to-day decisions during this momentous period.\", \"authors\": \"['Georges Lefebvre']\", \"publisher\" : \"Psychology Press\", \"text\" : \"This year marks the 217th anniversary of the beginning of the Great French Revolution with storming of the Bastille on July 14th. An old Chinese Communist leader, the late Zhou Enlai, was once asked by a reporter to sum up the important lessons of the French Revolution. In reply he answered that it was too early to tell what those lessons might be. Whether that particular story is true or not it does contain one important truth. Militants today at the beginning of the 21st century can still profit from reading the history of that revolution.Professor Lefebvre's two volume account of that revolution is still a good place to start. Although scholarship on various aspects of the French Revolution has mushroomed since his books first appeared, especially around the time of the 200th anniversary of the revolution, most of that work has been very specialized. After over 40 years these volumes still set the standard for a general overview of the convulsions of French and European society before the rise of the Napoleonic period.The French Revolution, like its predecessor the American Revolution, is covered with so much banal ceremony, flag- waving, unthinking sunshine patriotism and hubris it is hard to see the forest for the trees. The Bastille action while symbolically interesting is not where the real action took place nor was it politically the most significant event. For militants that comes much later with the rise of the revolutionary tribunals and the Committee of Public Safety under the leadership of the left Jacobins Robespierre and Saint Just. Their overthrow in 1794 by more moderate members of their own party, in what is known as the Thermidorian reaction, stopped the forward progression of the revolution although it did not return it back to the old feudal society. The forces unleashed by the revolution, especially among the land hungry peasantry, made that virtually impossible. In short, as has happened before in revolutionary history, the people and programs which supported the forward advancement of the revolution ran out of steam. The careerists, opportunists and those previously standing on the sidelines took control until they too ran out of steam. Not for the first or last time, the precarious balance of the different forces in society clashed and called out for a strongman. Napoleon was more than willing to be obliging when that time came.The values of the Enlightenment- the believe that human beings can more or less rationally order the way they organize society in the interest of social justice and human dignity, are under extreme attack today. These Enlightenment values are reflected in the successes and failures of the French revolution. So what can militants of the 21st century gather from those tumultuous experiences as we try to extend the gains of that revolution and defend Enlightenment values against the `bully boys and girls' of this world? The most obvious is that the very fact of the French revolution changed the whole nature of political discourse by the creation of a civil society. Today, that task may seem of little importance. However, at the time the vast majority of the population was treated by the old regime as a brute, silent herd. And was suppose to like it, to boot! Seem familiar.The French Revolution also highlights the need to defend the revolution against both active internal counterrevolutionary elements of the old regime and foreign powers opposed to the new order, the new way of doing business in society. This necessity also occurred previously in the English revolution where continental powers allied with segments of the old royal establishment tried to use Ireland and Scotland as bases to return the Stuarts. Later, in the Russian revolution that same phenomenon occurred with the White Guards and a seemingly world-wide array of hostile powers. In short, the old order will not give up without a fight. We should have that lesson etched in our brains.Probably the greatest service that Professor Lefebvre provides in his volumes is to encourage an understanding of the above-mentioned relationship of forces. That is, the policies of the various post-1989 governments in reaction to the various forces in Europe, particularly but not exclusively the British, that most certainly were trying overthrow the revolution and either return to the previous status quo or make France a subordinate client state. In fact, this writer argues that one cannot understand French domestic governmental policy in this period without an understanding of that interconnectedness. The various revolutionary governmental forms, culminating with the Committee of Public Safety under Robespierre, were increasingly charged with defense of the revolution by putting France on a multi-front war footing. That meant both raising troops, one way or another, and assuring the support of the sans-culottes and small peasant landowners by appropriate measures. Whether those governments did that well or poorly is up to the reader to decide. In any case, thanks Professor Lefebvre.\"}"}]}

He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence - while those who made a victory of those experiences turned them into an inner triumph. Frankl came to believe that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. This outstanding work offers us all a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the art of living.\", \"authors\": \"['Viktor E Frankl']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"Much of what we know about life in various Nazi concentration camps comes from Frankl, I realized as I finally read his book. I bought it when I was trying to support a friend who was enduring one of life's random tragedies. I do not believe in a god who never sends us more than we can bear. In fact, I don't believe God sends us good or ill events, and Frankl's work supports my view. What he does show is that under the most heinous of circumstances, humans have the ability to make moral choices, and that is powerful information.Frankl-- who survived when his pregnant wife, parents and other relatives did not-- went on to show that not all prisoners were moral and all guards immoral. Within extremely narrow parameters, both had the freedom to embrace life and to aid others. He was also insightful about what signaled impending death. I guess I should not be surprised that after the war, Frankl opposed the theory of collective guilt; he was loathe to condemn whole societies, which is what makes him out of step with many Holocaust scholars and (in my reading) with other prominent moral teachers of his era.The last part of the book sets out his theories of logotherapy in which he held that the purpose of psychotherapy is to help patients make meaning of their lives rather than find happiness or resolve various complexes. It's interesting that logotherapy is almost unknown today, although some of his ideas seem to bubble up in existential therapies. As it turns out, Man's Search is condensed from longer writings he produced after liberation. The book in English is so lucid that I forgot that he lived all this experience \"in German.\" Unlike many psychological writings, this one does not suffer from the restriction of categories that don't quite translate. I suspect that's one reason is still resonates with readers as it did with me.\"}"}]}

But in the terrible July of 1863, the poor and desperate of Paradise Alley would face a new catastrophe\u2014as flames from the war that was tearing America in two reached out to set their city on fire.\", \"authors\": \"['Kevin Baker']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harper Collins\", \"text\" : \"Among the aspects of \"Paradise Alley\" I enjoyed most was its success at making its many historical events tangible to the reader. In addition to the central episode--the New York Draft Riots--Baker covers, through flashbacks and asides, the Irish Potato Famine and the resulting, desperate emigration; the experiences, often horrific, of new immigrants to New York; the seediness and despair of the Sixth Ward and Five Points in lower Manhattan; the shanghaiing of men for maritime labor; the battlefields of the Civil War; the village of free blacks displaced by the creation of Central Park; miscegenation and racism in the North; and the twin iniquities of Southern slavery and fugitive slave catchers.In some ways, this is all too much, even for a historical novel. There are moments in \"Paradise Alley\" when the author is so busy paying attention to the history that he loses track of the fiction. The novel focuses on the travails of three women who, at times, seem conjured purely to bring together various historical moments: an Irish immigrant who has married a former slave and who is terrified of her ex-husband, driven mad by his experiences in the famine; her former sister-in-law, whose husband is off fighting the war against the South; and their neighbor, a prostitute \"kept\" by a reporter working for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune.Along with a plot that (it is clear from the beginning) will culminate in a melodramatic finale that will assemble all the principal characters in the cataclysm of the Draft Riot, the author ultimately falls back on stock personalities whose manner of thinking (randomly in italics) sometimes seems interchangeable and nearly always seem a century ahead of the times. But the biggest failure of the book is certainly \"Dangerous\" Johnny Dolan, who, like a monster in a horror novel, is the psychopath who is everywhere at once and who just won't die--although Baker's method of securing the fiend's exit is, I'll admit, both clever and unexpected.In effect, Baker's novel weds the realism of Zola to a modernism that portrays the world of its fictional nineteenth-century characters through twentieth-century eyes. Sometimes, it works; sometimes, the novel's machinations seem contrived in order to work in another index card from the author's research. Nevertheless, the scenes set in Ireland are especially solid, and the novel depicts quite effectively the horrors of what is \"probably the worst civic disturbance in the United States.\"\"}"}]}

But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, Moby-Dick is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Never losing its cultural presence, Melville\u2019s nautical epic has inspired many films over the years, including the film adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick\u2019s In the Heart of the Sea, starring Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw, and Brendan Gleeson, and directed by Ron Howard.

Some in my group read this book when they were in high school, but are enjoying it even more the second time around. It is not only a story told to perfection, but it's a book that offers landlubbers, as well as coastal residents, a chance to learn about whaling and the majesty of the ocean and it's inhabitants, with an emphasis on whales... the Sperm Whale in particular. Melville has a way of making the emotions felt by the many colorful characters in this book pertinent to all humanity. Read it. You'll like it.

His translation of Attila J\u00f3zsef is listed among the world classics cited by Harold Bloom in The Western Canon.Praise for Peter Hargitai's translation of Attila J\u00f3zsef: \"These grim, bitter, iron-cold poems emerge technically strong, spare and authentic in English, and they are admirably contemporary in syntax.\" -MAY SWENSON in Citation for the Academy of American Poets\"A rich nuanced translation by Peter Hargitai. These poems are ageless, mirroring the human conditions and focusing in humankind's existential loneliness.\" -MAXINE KUMIN\"I have long thought of Attila J\u00f3zsef as one of the great poets of the century, a tragic realist whose work beautifully redeemed the unbearable conditions of the life to which history condemned him. These new translations by Peter Hargitai will be welcomed by J\u00f3zsef's admirers and will certainly add to their number.\" -DONALD JUSTICE\"[Other] translations of J\u00f3zsef's work are stiff and academic, whereas Peter Hargitai's versions are colloquial and emotionally charged as the originals. Reading them one lapses into the silence that attends the reception of all great poetry.\" -DAVID KIRBY\", \"authors\": \"['Attila Jozsef']\", \"publisher\" : \"iUniverse\", \"text\" : \"Attila Jozsef Selected Poems of is a collection of 100 poems about his life from the loss of his mother and the abandonment of his father to the longing for his home country, Hungary. Translated by the award winning translator, Peter Hargitai, the book does not lose its original meaning intended by Jozsef. There is no \"candy coating\" just to make it flow; he makes it work by giving true insight into Jozsef's life. The poems are divided up into five sections marking the different times in his life.Attila Jozsef lived his life through his poetry and by using it as an escape; it was the only thing that kept him content during his years. The reader embarks on a journey of darkness, pain, and anger all in a quest for love to find someone that can replace the hole that his mother left in him when she died. As many women as Attila had not one of them could fill her void. Any happiness or love that he may feel is then seized by his battle with depression and he is brought back down to rock bottom.Two of my favorite poems of the book are, \"Night\" and \"Hearsay\" because the emotions come through intensely. \"I was born with a knife in my hand-they say this is just poetry,\" a line from the poem \"Hearsay.\" The imagery in \"Night\" is beautiful:\"Her raven hair floods my roomshe soothes my thoughts of doom,she's the one who lights the moon.\"Their strong connotation allows the reader to identify with Attila as if the reader were in his mind. His deep intellect has the power to keep your attention through each and every poem. It allows the reader to experience what he was going through. The pain and anguish you feel for Jozsef by the end of the book is heartfelt. In turn, Selected Poems of Attila Joszef is well deserving of four stars.\"}"}]}

But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream.\", \"authors\": \"['F. Scott Fitzgerald']\", \"publisher\" : \"Penguin\", \"text\" : \"+++++This interesting novel was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 to 1940). It takes place during \"The Jazz Age,\" a term Fitzgerald actually coined. This period of the early-to-mid-1920s \"was an age of miracles...an age of art...an age of excess, and...an age of satire.\"The novel is about Jay Gatsby (whose actual name was James Gatz), a newly wealthy Midwesterner-turned-Easterner who orders his life around one desire: to be reunited with Daisy Fay (she's now married and known as Daisy Buchanan), the love he lost five years earlier. His quest for the American Dream leads him from poverty to wealth and then into the arms of his beloved. By the end of the novel, we get to see the ugly side of the American Dream.There are many socially insightful themes evident in the story. Some include (1) wealth (a key theme), (2) superficiality and shallowness (3) selfishness (4) materialism (5) societal expectation (6) societal stratification (7) immorality and (8) appearances.Something else that this novel is known for is its \"breathtaking lyricism.\" As a writer, Fitzgerald is very sensory-orientated. Here is one small example of his fantastic writing found throughout the novel:\"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in a many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\"This particular book includes other relevant information and insight about the novel and its author. The most helpful for me were the \"explanatory notes\" that explained key terms in the novel. Here is an example:\"West Egg/East Egg: The fictionalized geography of [this novel] was based on the actual geography of Long Island and the borough of Queens. See map [that has the caption \"Long Island: East Egg to Manhattan].\"Finally another interesting thing about this particular book is that its cover (displayed above by Amazon) has the original dust cover that was on the first published novel. This is \"the most celebrated--and widely disseminated--jacket art in twentieth century American literature.\"In conclusion, be sure to read this engrossing novel to discover for yourself why \"Fitzgerald stands out as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century!\" As well, also discover why the social insight found in this novel is still highly relevant for the twenty-first century!!(first published 1925; this particular novel published 1996; 9 chapters; 175 pages)+++++\"}"}]}

I felt like I was right there in the dirty cell with them. I felt for all of the family and Malika's storytelling it was made this book. However there were some missing pieces to the puzzle. First of all, it is never made known as to why the General (Oufkir) would attempt to overthrow the government. There is no information on the political system of Morocco, so I am just left confused as to why the General did it, considering his families outcome. Also, once the Oufkirs escape from Bir-Jdyd, there seems to be a lapse in time once they are at the house with the garden. Malika doesn't describe what happens in those years, it just seems like there was alot of the same things happening. Maybe that is the case, but I just didn't feel like there was a significant synopsis from the house arrest to their final release years later.All in all, I would definitely recommend this book to others. I was shocked to find that a family was actually forced to endure the punishment of their father and couldn't believe something like this could happen in this day and age. It goes to show you anything is possible when dealing with other human beings. That being the negative side of the coin, the positive side is the human spirit that does eventually triumph.

Driven by political ambition and internal dissent, thrown into turmoil by rebellion and civil war, it changed and adapted, but it never fell. The balance of power between Byzantium in the east and Rome in the west ebbed and flowed, but the Empire never fell. And it continued to expand, taking in the New World, while still dominating the old. This ambitious and accomplished novel explores fifteen hundred years of alternate Roman history through the very human stories of some of those who lived through it: the soldier encountering the exoticism of the New World for the first time; the minor official exiled to Arabia for some misdemeanour whose meeting with a religious fanatic may have changed the course of history; the military hero seizing his destiny; the innocent British aristocrat witnessing the destruction of the royal family; the children who find the last emperor in a decaying wood are all vividly and memorably portrayed. Roma Eterna takes it's place among the great alternate histories.\", \"authors\": \"['Robert Silverberg']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"I have heard of this book off and on for years and being both a Romanphile and a sci-fi devotee I thought it was long past time to get it. I had to order it from the used booksellers here, and it turned out to be an expensive purchase, but when it arrived I was just so very excited to get it. That lasted just about as long as reading the dust jacket blurb.....which was basically the evil Roman empire had kept the Jewish people in bondage for thousands of years and now they were going to finally escape in spacecraft. Oh no. No, no, no......I nearly didn't read the book after that, but, as it turns out, this isn't an evil Roman empire book at all and the blurb was just about as misleading a one as I have ever read in my life.No, this book has it's problems, but it certainly isn't about Romans persecuting Jews for thousands of years as implied by the cover. The problems I had with the book are that it is not a novel but a series of short stories showing an alternate hsitory in which Rome does not fall. The short story approach creates a very choppy narrative and overall I didn't find the alternative history all that plausible or the writing that compelling. The book is OK, and I have enjoyed Silverberg as a writer in the past, but I was left fairly disappointed with this work. Part of the problem I think is that Silverberg never considered this as a novel...it just a series a different ideas he had at different times and created short stories out of. Then they are all strung together to make this tale. I'd love to read an alternative Roman history work where the author sat down and figured out the big picture first and then colored in all the details later. Robert Conroy did a good job of this in his \"1901\" which I found fascinating. My overall recommendation: you won't miss anything if you don't read this one.\"}"}]}

This delightful little book is loaded with scientific facts that aren't taught in standard biology classes, but it is also full of history and poetry. Why is a Fly Not a Horse? does not have all the answers, but it asks many of the right questions-in a style that is both entertaining and inspiring. Giuseppe Sermonti is retired Professor of Genetics at the University of Perugia. He discovered genetic recombination in antibiotic-producing Penicillium and Streptomyces and was Vice President at the XIV International Congress of Genetics (Moscow, 1980). Sermonti is Chief Editor of Rivista di Biologia/Biology Forum, one of the oldest still-published biology journals in the world, and he has published seven other books, including Dopo Darwin (\u00bfAfter Darwin), with R. Fondi (1980-1984).\", \"authors\": \"['Giuseppe Sermonti']\", \"publisher\" : \"Discovery Institute\", \"text\" : \"The proponents of intelligent design have exposed the weakness of neo-darwinism in much better ways than I could have, even though I've tried, even before the movement began. It doesn't take a scientist to recognize an underlying philosophy and the glaring absense of REAL proof of BLIND forces being the true origin of species. ID proponents acknowledge darwinian evolution's place as a means to SURVIVE but, as Sermonti points out, it's as much for animals to revert back to a previous state, as it is for them to change.The typical mainstream scientist, not unlike the old clergy of the Dark Ages, means to avoid confusing the public with the real meat of the argument. Smart enough to realize taht people will \"regress\" to their \"less fit\" religious thinking, the hidden premises of neo-darwinism are never presented in their entirety to the public. Those days are over. With more and more scientists coming \"out of the closet\" the mission of the mainstreamers to \"enlighten\" the public with their senseless, empty dogma will fail.This particular book has some excellent prose and the author clearly has a love of nature and its majesty. He exposes the emptiness and short-sighted emphasis on the genetic CODE, when nature is found in its FORM. He points out how code is merely a language. Not only that, the current evidence indicates that genes seem to do pretty much everything but determine form (with some exceptions). Furthermore, Sermonti asks, who or what is there to decipher the language--a language far too complex for any computer to utilize and predict what a genetic code will express in actual character. He discusses, for example, why tigers look so regal and fierce, as opposed to looking like a squirrel. Is that necessary for survival? No, that doesn't disprove neo-darwinism, but it is an example of what we miss, when all we care about is a bunch of protein molecules.It is claimed that the genetic code evolved from a simpler code, but no evidence of this exists. Sermonti's book largely is about perspective and love of nature and creation. He illustrates much of the dogmatic, arrogant and narrow-minded views of the zealous neo-darwinists and proposes a new way to look at life. The prose is powerful and moving, expressing a love of nature and a passion for science at the same time. It may well have a few flaws, but it engages the important issues involved in the neo-darwinist vs. id proponent debate. I recommend this brilliantly entertaining and enlightening book.\"}"}]}

His experience comes across in this book, as does his personable way of presenting the information. Yes, there are equations. But this is not a soil physics textbook as much as it is a geosciences perspective on the vadose zone. This perspective is based on his extensive experience in arid and semi-arid settings, but some of his comments shed light on vadose zone processes in more humid climates. I should add that his treatment of this dry subject is not &quot;dry&quot;, and relatively easy to read given the textbook breadth of material covered. Each paragraph could be expanded into a separate dissertation. Stephens has condensed a wealth of material, both practical and theoretical. I recommend it.\"}"}]}

The book has been translated into 25 languages and is distributed by the Self-Realization Fellowship, the organization (based in California) founded by Yogananda himself. Their teachings are known as Kriya Yoga.I haven't read the entire book (yet), but so far, I don't think \"autobiography\" is the right word for it. The work is rather a devotional and an exposition of the Kriya Yoga teachings. In a sense, it could be called the Gospel of Yogananda. Indeed, the author's teachings seem to be a blend of Hinduism and Christianity, with Theosophy and New Thought features. (I also read some of the treatises in Yogananda's voluminous work \"The Second Coming of Christ\").A large part of \"The Autobiography of a Yogi\" consists of miracle tales, often similar to those found in the Gospels. People are raised from the dead, Yogananda's guru Sri Yukteswar is resurrected with a physical body (although it was previously cremated), and one chapter is entitled \"The Christlike life of Lahiri Mahasaya\". Other themes are more Hindu, as when the clairvoyant Yogananda manages to find his dead and re-incarnated friend Kashi. There are also stories about a mysterious cosmic being called Babaji who lives in the Himalayas and never dies...Another large portion of the book contains Yogananda's impressions of famous people he encountered during his journeys. Among others, he met Gandhi, Tagore and the Catholic stigmatic Theresa Neumann. He even describes one of Neumann's trances. His meeting with U.S. president Coolidge is only mention in passing, however. A humorous photo shows the president peeking out of a White House window during a Yogananda photo-op!OK, I admit I was fascinated. ;-)The defining feature of Paramahamsa Yogananda seems to be his reverential attitude towards Jesus Christ as an avatar of the Divine. He seems to take the virgin birth, crucifixion and physical resurrection quite seriously and literally, even to the point of using the KJV, while nevertheless attempting to integrate Jesus into an essentially Hindu worldview with karma, reincarnation, maya, lila, etc. Interestingly, the author does allow for at least some bad karma to be forgiven, either by Jesus or by an accomplished Hindu master.I will probably continue reading this book.

A place for soft things; a place for independence; a place for respect; a place to live in peace. This is tied in very strongly to socioeconomic status, age, and race, and the issues that it brings up about the American dream are as relevant today as they were then.The language was interesting. It is apparent that the novel was written many decades ago, and there are a bunch of turns of phrase that I had never heard before (but could guess at, for the most part).I liked the structure. One character was disagreeable and one character was mean, but there wasn't really an antagonist. It really was a good description of the best laid plans of mice and men going awry.

For a short book, Steinbeck does a very good job of creating empathy with the different characters such that the reader can understand their wrongdoing and still appreciate them as a person.Something that I learned: in the US, you can't execute mentally handicapped citizens for their crimes, but the Supreme Court left it up to states that practice the death penalty how to interpret that. Apparently, Texas' standard is that someone is exempt from the death penalty if they are as intelligent as Lennie Small [...]. Horrifying.\"}"}]}

An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as \u201ca kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.\u201d A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today\u2019s leading Steinbeck scholars. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Right from the start I fell in love with Steinbeck's unassuming, delicate language and his vividly real characters. The theme of loneliness on the &quot;ranch&quot; where the main characters work really haunts the reader, and we feel great sympathy for the barren lives lead by the characters - matched by the bleak, dusty Salinas landscape. All the main characters suffer from some form of prejudice, which in turn isolates them from the main thread of communication in the mid-west community - from Lennie, who is punished for his mental disability, to Candy, punished for his age, the negro, Crooks and the &quot;jailbait&quot;, Curley's Wife. Each character suffers such absolute desolation in the face of promminence, I couldn't help feeling such strong empathy for the tragic people who inhabit this book. It is a credit to Stenbeck's unique eye for socialistic views and values that he draws such desparing, but neccassary, attention to the &quot;abused&quot; little man of 20's America.\"}"}]}

One incident was this: Charlie was the last person to stay for the tour, and Willy Wonka had a glass elevator that could go every where from up, to down, to sideways, even diagionally. Charlie didn't know it but Willy Wonka had a special trip for him. They walked into the elevator terribly frightened. Willy Wonka pressed a button that said, \"UP AND OUT.\" And suddenly the elevator speed upwards-no twistings or turnings and kept going faster and faster. Suddenly they heard a lout crash and saw wood flying all over. And soon enough they saw the whole town under their feet. (Remember it was a glass elevator). It felt to them like they weren't standing on anything. Since it was going so fast Grandpa Joe asked how fast it was going, and Willy Wonka repeated, \"Candy power! One million candy power!\"If you enjoy fiction stories that are filled with comedy and imagination his book Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is for you.\"}"}]}

His austere nature and harsh ways of interacting with his wife and Jody (especially Jody) were not uncommon during a time when grubbing a living took every waking minute -- which is the timeline of this fine story. But the conflict Steinbeck expertly wove into the story was a critical part of it; it was not a bit contrived. We noted that Jody didn't hate his lot in life as a consequence of stern discipline, the complete absence of tender and caring outpourings from his father. Indeed, the discipline was present when the father was not: Jody caught himself pointing his .22 rifle at a forbidden target and reminded himself that ammunition would not be forthcoming for yet another year if his father had been there to see that act. Jody did, after all, have a .22 rifle -- a prior gift from his father, one with enormous meaning and carrying with it indelible notions of responsibility.Billy Buck, a masterful Steinbeck stroke of characterization, was the buffer that absorbed some of the abrasiveness handed down by father to son, at other times dulling its cutting edge, and at still others obliquely giving the boy a means of rationalizing over it -- it isn't personal, Jody, just your father's way. It was clear that Jody was well aware of the latter, too.His inability to embrace the boy with outward expressions of fatherly love was otherwise expressed by Carl in the gift of the .22, even burdened as it was by a year of abstinence from using it, and then by the gift of the red pony -- which also came with a price: warnings of the consequences that would come if the pony interfered with Jody's chores or school. Giving with one hand and threatening to take back with the other was not an uncommon form of conditional generousity during those tough times, and it's not to be despised now.Carl's outspoken intolerance of Jody's maternal grandfather's despondency over his obsolescence was Steinbeck's means of revealing to us that Carl Tiflin did, actually, have a thread of feelings down deep, demonstrated by his remorse after discovering that Grandfather had overheard Carl trashing him and his ideas of &quot;westering.&quot;For all his faults, Carl Tiflin was an honorable, responsible, hardworking man. Those are the recollections Jody the man would have of his father, with never a thought of the qualities other observers disliked.Too many fathers today don't have the stuff for stern discipline, or discipline to any degree, even though it's more essential today than it was in Jody's time. So we have novels about wild and courageously untameable teens despising and defying their parents, fictional characters who are mirrors of too many of their contemporaries, just as Jody was likely akin to many of his.Maybe I earned a good measure of empathy for Carl -- and for Jody's uncritical acceptance of his stern ways. My own father, also a stern disciplinarian, was incapable of showing affection. Once, on no particular occasion where a gift was called for (and I got precious few when they were called for), he presented me with a fine cap pistol, a top-of-the-line model that made me the envy of my friends, few of whom were as poor as we were. But the presentation was made with grave warnings that it might have to serve as my Christmas present, admonitions against breaking it,leaving it out in the weather, and with a mitigating &quot;reason&quot; for the gift: It was a tool with which I could scare crows out of the maize field, blackbirds from the tomato patch.Somehow, even then, I saw through his gravity and appreciated, truly appreciated, the cap pistol as an exceedingly generous gift. The power of that gift and my gratitude for it, as unworthy as I was often reminded that I was, is demonstrated by my vivid recollection of the act over a half-century later.Steinbeck would have failed miserably with a story in which Carl Tiflin was an effusively loving father, eager to obtain frequent hugs and insincere expressions of &quot;love&quot; from Jody. He could have welcomed Grandfather into the Tiflin home with open arms. He could have shown some realization that old Gitano at least had some use for the equally useless ancient horse he soon planned to shoot (instead of his rationalizing over the benefit of saving pasture grass). But what kind of story would that have been? Not a Steinbeck, but a touchy-feely piece of crap with a good shot at best-seller status today.Obviously, many contemporary readers don't like The Red Pony. But the vast majority of us who appreciate literature do. A sure sign of the story's worth is that it's still around after all these years. And it'll be around when most of what's written today will be long forgotten.Doug Briggs\"}"}]}

Borlaug and other noted scientists and scholars The modern environmental movement began with the publication of three seminal works, Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring, Paul Ehrlich's \"The Population Bomb, and the Club of Rome's \"The Limits to Growth. These books' dismal visions of a poisoned, over-populated, resource-depleted world spiraling down toward environmental collapse are today's conventional wisdom. And every year we hear about new \"conclusive\" reports from special interest groups claiming that our atmosphere's temperatures are soaring, our air and water are more polluted, our cities are more crowded, and our global food supply is more precarious than ever before. However, according to a number of leading scientists from around the world, members of the environmental movement are guilty of twisting--sometimes manufacturing--the facts in an effort to frighten people into joining their cause. In this eye-opening book, some of the most respected researchers in the country explode the myths behind much of the doom and gloom of today's environmental movement. You will discover how the hysteria about global warming, overpopulation, mass extinctions, imminent famines, biotechnology, energy shortages, and more are grounded not in reason but in false science and a fear of progress. When placed beside the overwhelming facts, some of the most pervasive eco-myths crumble, including: Myth: Antarctica is melting due to global warming--threatening to raise ocean levels Fact: Antarctica has been cooling--and its glaciers thickening--for the past 30 years Myth: The global population is growing faster than our ability toproduce food Fact: Global fertility rates are falling dramatically, and with advanced technology, farmers are producing more food using fewer resources than ever before Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generators Fact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmills Myth: Modern pesticides and fertilizers are increasing the rates of cancer in humans Fact: No study has ever shown that anyone has developed cancer from the legal application of pesticides, and environmental pollution accounts for at most 2 percent of all cancer cases versus 30 percent caused by tobacco use And many more Ultimately, this book shows that uniting much of the environmental movement is an agenda that is not so much anti-pollution as it is anti-human. \"Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths lays out the \"true state of the planet, which, as you'll discover, is more healthy, vibrant, and clean than ideologically motivated environmentalists want you to believe.\", \"authors\": \"['Ronald Bailey']\", \"publisher\" : \"Prima Lifestyles\", \"text\" : \"The issue of global warming is scaremongering, a massive red herring to make workers take their eyes off the tasks facing us - stopping deindustrialisation, unemployment, the destruction of our services, the European Union's destruction of our nation Britain. Scare stories about global warming, melting ice caps and glaciers, intensifying storms and droughts, a `Day After Tomorrow'-style ice age, overpopulation, mass extinctions, imminent famines, nuclear proliferation and energy shortages are grounded not in reason but in false science and a fear of progress. They are kin to medieval fears of apocalypse. We need to denounce the doom-mongers who portray us as helpless victims, at the mercy of events beyond our control as a nation.The facts are that Antarctica has been cooling and its glaciers thickening for the past 30 years. Global fertility rates are falling dramatically, and with advanced technology, farmers are producing more food using fewer resources than ever before. Environmental pollution accounts for at most 2% of all cancer cases versus 30% caused by tobacco use. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the world's forests covered 40.24 million square kilometres in 1950, and 43.04 million in 1994. 80% of the world's original rainforest is still intact. Sea levels in the region of the Pacific around the island nation of Tuvalu have been falling.Amicus and the NUM recently warned that a growing crisis in our electricity industry will lead to blackouts and further electricity price rises. They warned against relying on oil and gas from unstable regions like southern Russia, the Middle East and North and West Africa. Powergen confirmed how right the unions are when it recently told us, \"From 29 November 2004 your electricity prices will rise by around 44p a week. Why the price increase? There are many reasons, for example: producing energy is now more expensive, so the wholesale price of energy has risen for all suppliers. The UK's gas supply is also declining so we must now spend more importing gas from around the world.\"The unions warned that EU directives would add to our energy problems, particularly the carbon emissions trading directive which would curtail the lifetime of existing power stations. The unions believe it is vital that the nation invests in clean coal fired power stations and in power engineering and manufacturing industries to develop expertise in designing and building new power stations.In 2003 nuclear power stations provided 23% of Britain's electricity. By 2010, a third of these will have reached the end of their operating lives and will be closed, and nuclear power will account for just 16% of our electricity supply. Only two new stations are under construction. The closures will reduce Britain's ability to generate our own dependable energy supply. We need to plan and build more new nuclear power stations. France's nuclear plants produce three quarters of the country's power, one of the cheapest energy supplies in Europe.We need to reduce energy waste, estimated to cost 5 billion a year, and rationally use our resources. We need to develop new technologies to economise on energy use. The government has failed to invest in Combined Heat and Power. We need more R&D; into carbon free and carbon sequestration technologies. Biomass crops could be grown especially for use as environmentally-friendly fuel. This would boost farm diversity and create rural jobs. It could be competitive against conventional hydrocarbon-based energy generation, and could meet 10% of our energy needs.Friends of the Earth say, \"Renewable energy has the potential to provide all our needs.\" Not so - hydroelectricity, wind and tidal sources provide just 3% of our present energy, and wind and solar energy are intermittent: their annual power output is only 25% of the potential output if operating always at full power; by contrast, nuclear power's output is 90%. Blackouts three quarters of the time, anyone?\"}"}]}

It tells the story of Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman that enjoys a good cocktail party. Oskar has a wife, Emilie, but he cheats on her and doesn't treat her well. He takes over a factory previously owned by Jews. Schindler then begins to use imprisoned Jews to work in the factory. They were cheaper than normal laborers, so he used them as a way to make a larger profit. The cruelty of the Nazis progressed, and people in the ghettos began to say, \"An hour of life is still life.\" It is amazing that nobody showed any resistance to this Nazi torture. Even a drinking buddy of Schindler's, Amon Goeth, brutally killed many people. Goeth even killed a young child that hugged his legs, pleading for life. Oskar began to get a soft spot for Jews, thinking that they should be respected as human beings. Some of the Jews he saw in the camps and ghettos were old prewar friends of his. He spent a lot of money in the black market to get extra food for them. At one point, Schindler was jailed, accused of being a \"Jew Kisser.\" He was let out with a fine and a strong warning. He also received a letter that basically told him he better exterminate Jews or else. To pass SS inspections, he used bribes, like bottles of vodka and cognac. He opened up a second camp (mostly at his expense), which produced nothing. He did it just to save more Jews. They all wanted to get on Schindler's List. No Jews were murdered in Schindler's camps. Schindler's Jews were very thankful for him. It is true that one individual can make a difference, Schindler proves it by saving the lives of so many innocent people who, if it weren't for him, would have died.I enjoyed this book. It was packed with some interesting and unbelievable Holocaust facts. This book told an amazing story of life, love, and courage.

It offers a scintillating view of those dramatic and fateful days when much of the modern world was sketched out, when countries were created\u2014Iraq, Yugoslavia, Israel\u2014whose troubles haunt us still. Winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize \u2022 Winner of the PEN Hessell Tiltman Prize \u2022 Winner of the Duff Cooper Prize Between January and July 1919, after \u201cthe war to end all wars,\u201d men and women from around the world converged on Paris to shape the peace. Center stage, for the first time in history, was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who with his Fourteen Points seemed to promise to so many people the fulfillment of their dreams. Stern, intransigent, impatient when it came to security concerns and wildly idealistic in his dream of a League of Nations that would resolve all future conflict peacefully, Wilson is only one of the larger-than-life characters who fill the pages of this extraordinary book. David Lloyd George, the gregarious and wily British prime minister, brought Winston Churchill and John Maynard Keynes. Lawrence of Arabia joined the Arab delegation. Ho Chi Minh, a kitchen assistant at the Ritz, submitted a petition for an independent Vietnam. For six months, Paris was effectively the center of the world as the peacemakers carved up bankrupt empires and created new countries. This book brings to life the personalities, ideals, and prejudices of the men who shaped the settlement. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China, and dismissed the Arabs. They struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews. The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; above all they failed to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made the scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. She refutes received ideas about the path from Versailles to World War II and debunks the widely accepted notion that reparations imposed on the Germans were in large part responsible for the Second World War. Praise for Paris 1919 \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get into a war, but ending it is a more arduous matter. It was never more so than in 1919, at the Paris Conference. . . . This is an enthralling book: detailed, fair, unfailingly lively. Professor MacMillan has that essential quality of the historian, a narrative gift.\u201d \u2014Allan Massie, The Daily Telegraph (London)\", \"authors\": \"['Margaret MacMillan']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House\", \"text\" : \"This book deserves all the accolades it has received. MacMillan has written a remarkably clear and engaging account of the Paris peace conference of 1919, painting vivid imagery of the places and personalities involved.She thoroughly disects the main characters; Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George; and to a lesser extent Italy's Orlando, giving a revealing glimpse into their thought processes, loyalties, belief systems, foibles, idiosyncrasies, and failings, as well as a fascinating look at how they all three were simultaneously engaged in rivalry and cooperation, public displays of mutual support amid private quarrels. Reading of the sometimes congenial, sometimes vitriolic relationship among the three is an amuzing insight into the discordant realities of world diplomacy.She also deftly introduces the secondary players who often had influential, even pivotal, roles in close association with the three leaders, and often gives interesting bits of trivia about their interrelationship with other world leaders and events and where their political career led them subsequent to the peace conference.The book is well-paced and perfectly organized so as to make clear who each of the stakeholders were, explaining their position and allegiances in the war, fleshing out their fears and hopes for the peace conference, and delving into what each was thinking internally and how it often differed from what they wished to convey publicly.MacMillan does a masterful job explaining all the many micro-regions in Europe where small, isolated cultures often had their fates decided by the flippant horse trading of detached diplomats in Paris. The history, religion and customs of these micro-cultures was often the thorn in the side of negotiations and the cause of so much dispute over where to draw the lines on the map.This book also has much to teach us about the consequences of war and the pomposity with which the victors typically impose punitive burdens on the defeated side. MacMillan draws a clear illustration of how the debt and financial burden imposed upon Germany led to the nationalism and resentment that gave rise to Adolf Hitler and another world war just twenty years later.MacMillan manages to convey a plentiful amount of historical data without ever being dry or boring. It is, in fact, a very captivating, narrative account. Highly recommended.\"}"}]}

In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed between two ice floes. With no options left, Shackleton and a skeleton crew attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. Their survival, and the survival of the men they left behind, depended on their small lifeboat successfully finding the island of South Georgia--a tiny dot of land in a vast and hostile ocean. In Endurance, the definitive account of Ernest Shackleton's fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage that has defined heroism for the modern age.\", \"authors\": \"['Alfred Lansing']\", \"publisher\" : \"Basic Books\", \"text\" : \"All I know is that &quot;Endurance&quot; is too soft a word to describe what this crew went through. &quot;Superhuman perseverance&quot;? &quot;Beyond All Odds&quot;?

While at times very detailed, especially at the beginning, you will find yourself craving the details as the journey of these adventurers goes on and on. The outcome seems so unlikely that it's apt to whet your appetite for more information about Shackelton and his crew. This particular edition has terrific photos and is worth paying a little more for than the regular paperback. This story turned me into an Antartica nut- buying just about everything I could get my hands on. I've recommended this book to lots of people and everyone thought it was utterly amazing. Don't miss this real life adventure story. It'll leave you shaking your head in disbelief!\"}"}]}

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor & Francis, an informa company.\", \"authors\": \"['F.A. Hayek']\", \"publisher\" : \"Routledge\", \"text\" : \"In _The Road to Serfdom_ the Nobel Prize winning economist F. A. Hayek makes a profound case against socialism and economic planning in favor of the traditional \"classical liberal\" position, which originally consisted of advocates of the principle of \"laissez-faire\". Arguing from the point of view of such classical liberals as J. S. Mill, Alexis de Toqueville (who inspired the title of this book), Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, and Lord Acton (\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\"), as well as economists of the \"Austrian school\" and von Mises, Hayek argues that what was (and still is) termed \"liberalism\" in his day is in fact an abdication of the true ideal of liberty in favor of a redefinition of this term. Hayek shows how socialism and economic planning, such as that advocated by economists such as Keynes for example, have failed in both Russia and Germany. According to Hayek, economic interventionism, planning, and centralization are leading the state on \"the road to serfdom\" and destroying individual liberty. Fundamental to any notion of liberty is the belief in private property and Hayek argues that liberty is impossible without private property following Hume. While many who might advocate socialism will accept that liberty is impossible without private property, they still continue to push their ideology because they believe it will somehow enable man to focus on \"higher things\". Hayek argues that this itself is a conceit and shows the fundamental importance of economics and money in our lives. Hayek wrote this book near the end of the Second World War, and he shows that many of the socialists in Britain were coming close to advocating the same principles which were used by Hitler to establish his dictatorship. In particular, the works of the socialist theorist Werner Sombart played an important role in the economic understanding of the Third Reich. Hayek suggests that Nazism was made possible by German socialism and that in fact many individuals on one side of the communist/Nazi split could easily go back and forth between the two alternating in their hatred for the West. Many in the Third Reich regime such as Moeller van den Bruck, railed against the \"West\" (as it was understood by them, not the meaning it is given now where it would of course include the German nation) and its institutions as well as the ideals of classical liberalism. Hayek shows that there are indeed totalitarians in our midst who in the name of security will abolish our economic freedoms if given the opportunity to do so. While the United States claim to abide by capitalism, it continues to amount a burgeoning government bureaucracy and a monstrous \"welfare-warfare state\". Individuals such as Hilaire Belloc and Herbert Spencer had pointed out the dangers in such notions as socialism and statism earlier in the century, and Hayek has taken off from many of their writings. Hayek argues that socialism is a product of Germanic thought while he affirms the thought of certain individuals in Britain such as John Stuart Mill against the Germans. These remarks can probably be understood in the light of his times which had just witnessed a world confrontation against Fascism and National Socialism. Hayek concludes with a chapter on internationalism which he advocates in the classical liberal sense, but he also shows the dangers involved in the kind of \"world unity\" schemes which were then being devised and were to take shape in such bodies as the League of Nations and the United Nations. My copy of this book includes an excellent introduction by another Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman. In this introduction Friedman makes two points which I believe are worth mentioning. First, he argues that it is ironic that many of those regarded as the intellectual elite continue to accept the ideal of collectivism against that of individualism, basing their arguments on emotion and not on reason. Secondly, he notes the irony of the fact that socialist nations such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, China, and the former East Germany had to develop walls to keep their citizens within, while capitalist nations have been forced to use police forces to keep too many people from coming in. This itself illustrates the great failure of the socialist ideal. While the intellectual \"elite\" continue to cling to their dying ideal of socialism and disparage individuals such as Hayek, history shows that their schemes will result in failure. Hopefully, they will continue to be opposed in the future by all people who consider themselves lovers of liberty, in the true sense of the word.\"}"}]}

Margaret Mitchell\u2019s page-turning, sweeping American epic has been a classic for over eighty years.

WINNER OF NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AND PULITZER PRIZE 'For sheer readability I can think of nothing it must give way before' The New Yorker 'What makes some people come through catastrophes and others, apparently just as able, strong, and brave, go under?\u2019 Margaret Mitchell\", \"authors\": \"['Margaret Mitchell']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House\", \"text\" : \"Easily the best piece of American fiction I have ever read. It is not only one of the most touching love stories of all time &quot; Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman ?&quot; is one of most beautiful things I have ever heard a man say to a woman - it is an amazing depiction of Civil War history, told from the southern perspective. And Rhett just spoils you - because you keep comparing every man you meet with him and they just don't come even close. Despite the fact that I'm a woman, when I read the book, I identified far more with Rhett as a heroic character then I did with Scarlett, because he is so unabashedly honest about why he does things, and he has courage to say and do things because he believes in them, even if the community he is a part of is too shortsighted or too willfully blind to see the truth of what he says. Scarlett is just a hardheaded egocentric little brat, and the only admirable part of her personality is her neverending grit and determination to survive against all odds during Reconstruction despite incurring the wrath of her society. But personally despite the fact that Rhett thinks they're right for each other, because they're both rebels, I personally think she's too stupid for him, she just never thinks about anything except what she wants and how she's going to get it. But I suppose going by the time in which the book was written women were expected to be stupider than men. Of course, in some parts of the world, including where I come from, it's still considered a good thing. Rhett is the best thing that happened to Scarlett, that's definete, though whether she's the best thing to happen to him is questionable. Maybe if he'd been able to stretch her mind and her heart a little while they were married I would think she was good enough for him. Aside from the personal story which has resoundingly real characters and the epic tale of the Old South, this book ( and the movie ) serves as stunning anti-war statement. It makes you realize how terribly futile and a waste of effort, resources, and most of all people, war can be. Anyone who misses this book has missed out on something wonderful. And as far as the end is concerned, it was really no more then she deserved after ignoring him for years and years, but of course you do want to know they eventually end up together, because you know that they will make each other happy.\"}"}]}

The written part of the tutorials is good and is not cluttered with theories - you just do the tutorials, maybe this is the reason for a very thin book. The tips that are given are very good and valueable. I like the fact a big tutorial was architectural related so I could relate to it very easily although I would try to solve the problems (modeling-wise) in a different way.The book sits easily on the table and is also lightweight so you can read it in your bed .The book definitely demonstrates how easy it is to work in Maya (I compare it to my little knowledge with LightWave which was my second best contender to be my 3D Package but lacked many needed features)All in All - a Great book , buy it and you will not regret it.\"}"}]}

Set in England and France during the darkest days of World War II, Charlotte Gray, like Birdsong, depicts a complex love affair that is both shaped and thwarted by war. It is 1942. London is blacked out, but France is under a greater darkness, as the occupying Nazi forces encroach ever closer in a tense waiting game. Charlotte Gray, a volatile but determined young woman, travels south from Edinburgh. Working in London, she has a brief but intense love affair with an RAF pilot. When his plane is lost over France, she contrives to go there herself to work in the Resistance and to search for him--but then is unwilling to leave as she finds that the struggle for the country's fate is intimately linked to her own battle to take control of her life. Faulks's novel is an examination of lost paradises, politics without belief, the limits of memory, the redemptive power of art and the existence of hope beyond reason. It is also a brilliant evocation of life in Occupied France and, more significantly, a revelation of the appalling price many Frenchmen paid to survive in unoccupied, so-called Free France. As the men, women and children of Charlotte's small town prepare to meet their terrible destiny, the truth of what took place in wartime France is finally exposed. When private lives and public events fatally collide, the roots of the characters' lives are torn up and exposed. These harrowing scenes are presented with the passion and narrative force that readers will recall from Birdsong. Charlotte Gray will attract even more readers to Faulks's remarkable fiction.\", \"authors\": \"['Sebastian Faulks']\", \"publisher\" : \"Vintage\", \"text\" : \"When I read Charlotte Gray I was at first prepared for a war-time love-story, but I found the story-line made me want to read on and find out what was going to happen. I found Charlotte's feelings for Gregory to be a little too complex. I enjoyed the idea of Charlotte taking over the &quot;Dominique&quot; character. The interrment of Lavade and his subsequent death I found extremely painful but the imprisonment of Andre and Jacob caused me sleepless nights. I still have visions of them in my memory.\"}"}]}

Among the most empowering of the forgotten elements are references to a science with the power to bring everlasting healing to our bodies and initiate an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between governments and nations. In his groundbreaking new book, The Isaiah Effect, Gregg Braden turns to the Isaiah Scroll, perhaps the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1946, to offer insight into a powerful form of ancient prayer. In The Isaiah Effect, Braden, author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, combines research in quantum physics with the works of the prophet Isaiah and the ancient Essenes. He demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom, and that we have the power to influence those possibilities. In addition to describing multiple futures, the Isaiah texts take us one step further, clearly describing the science of how we choose our futures. Tracing key words of Isaiah's text back to their original language, we discover how he taught a mode of prayer that was lost to the West during Biblical editing in the fourth century. Braden offers detailed accounts of how elements of this mode of prayer have been applied in a variety of situations, ranging from healing life-threatening conditions to entire villages using collective prayer to prevail during the 1998 fires in southern Peru. In each instance, the correlation between the offering of the prayer and a shift of the events in question was beyond coincidence--the prayers had measurable effects! As modern science continues to validate a relationship between our outer and inner worlds, it becomes more likely that a forgotten bridge links the world of our prayers with that of our experience. Each time we engage ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities with Isaiah's life-affirming message of hope, we secure nothing less than our future and the future of the only home we know.\", \"authors\": \"['Gregg Braden']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harmony\", \"text\" : \"I got so absorbed in this book I couldn't put it down. For some time, I have been trying to link my spiritual beliefs and prayer with what I have learned as a coach about the Law of Attraction. This book clearly did that for me.

This edition is an exact reprinting of the original 1939 book written by Robert L. May for Montgomery Ward, illustrated by Denver Gillen.Rudolph lives in a reindeer village (not the North Pole, as you probably expect); he is made fun of by his peers because of his bright, red nose, is shy and lonesome and very, very sad. Like any good reindeer, Rudolph obeyed his parents and was hopeful that Santa would treat him the same as he treated the others. Meanwhile, Santa is facing terrible weather conditions and isn't sure he will be able to see through this Christmas Eve fog. Santa begins his journey, moving slowly and carefully, until he reaches the place where the deer live. There, he is amazed to find Rudolph's room well-lit. He is even more amazed when he finds out why it's well-lit! Santa asks Rudolph to help him through the remainder of the night, which Rudolph does. As Christmas dawn breaks, they return to Rudolph's home where he is hailed as a hero and Santa asks Rudolph to promise to serve \"On future dark trips, as COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF!\"Many Rudolph fans will actually find themselves surprised that the book is a bit different than the movie and the song - did you know, for example, that the book starts, and ends, with almost the exact same words as Clement C. Moore's 'Twas the Night Before Christmas? Really, you just can't call yourself a fan without ever reading the original. The illustrations, by Denver Gillen, are the originals, as well. Even though newer depictions are great, nothing compares to these. They are simple and have few colors (red, a pale green, and brown, mostly, with shades of blue here and there), but they're absolutely perfect for the poem, not to mention the AGE of the poem. Created as a marketing tool for Montgomery Ward, May's Rudolph is two fantastic stories in one. The story of Rudolph is one but there's also the story of his creation in 1939, which is detailed in the front of the book.

The result is a surprisingly insightful look at the problems of basic government.The science fiction here is understated. The basic notion is that mankind is rapidly expanding into the galaxy in a new age of adventure. Survival skills are therefore paramount, and that is the other theme of this novel.Recommended.

Bridget Jones -much given to irony -is a single who eats, drinks and smokes too much.She is disorganized, insecure, weight obsessed- a woman trying to cope with her crazy boss and crazier assignments in her job.The book, which chronicles one year in her life, starts with a series of New Year's resolutions to quit smoking, loose 10 pounds, find a decent boyfriend, and develop ''inner poise.'' Or as she puts it: ''I will not sulk about having no boyfriend and instead develop inner poise and authority and sense of self as woman of substance, complete without boyfriend, as best way to obtain boyfriend.''Moreover she starts to write a diary and each diary entry begins with her weight, number of calories eaten, the alcohol units she consumed, cigarettes smoked, and moments spent on having negative thoughts.Bridget Jones fights with the daily problems of life. Every girl and woman could identify with her very well, because she is a girl like you and me. A real problem for Bridget is her mother. She always wants to find a new boyfriend for her, which makes family celebrations so gruesome for her. Her mother always knows everything better and wants to start a new life with already 60 years. She has a boyfriend which is an additional problem for Bridget and her parents.Ms. Jones best friend is homosexual and so both of them have nearly the same problem. No man! He helps her to manage daily problems and the other way round.Bridget slips from one embarrassing situation into the next. There are a lot of funny parts to read in the book. For example the situation as Bridget should report something from a fire department and she is- how else could it be- too late. But this is not the only situation where she shows us how clumsy a human being could be.Well, it's hard not to laugh with and at Bridget's problems. Any woman who has ever had weight woes or relationship woes will feel Bridget's pain. This book taught me to look at the bright side of life and not take things too seriously. Especially as I read the result of one year diet, she lost 33kg but get 32,5kg back so all in all she lost 0,5kg. No chocolate for the whole year and the favourite jeans doesn't fit anyway.The same with smoking! She can not give it up!I personally recommend this book to everyone who likes reading about a woman who is a little bit like everybody of us. I am sure, guys will find it amusing and entertaining as well, especially in getting to know the \"backstage\" of a woman's lifestyle and her innermost thoughts and obsessions. It is so unbelievably true to our nature.There's even a little Bridget Jones in you!\"}"}]}

Bush, and some of his predecessors. We are given graphic examples of how the power inherent in the presidency changes the men who occupy the White House--example: tying up international air traffic for an hour while the President gets a $500 haircut from a Hollywood barber on the runway at Los Angeles International Airport, knowing full well that while Air Force One is on the runway no one else can take off or land. Talk about insensitive arrogance!Kessler, a Washington Post reporter with fourteen non-fiction books to his credit, and a New York Times best selling author, uses all of his sources, including interviews with well-known people in and out of this and other administrations, to elicit telling anecdotes and observations that expose the characters of this and other, former presidents. The obvious comparisons are telling.The Clintons were prone to screaming obscene insults to each other in private, while projecting the image of a loving couple in public; Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon are depicted as paranoid egomaniacs; Jimmy Carter as aloof, ignoring his servants; both presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan as sensitive to others, thanking them for their services, calling them by name, and maintaining friendly relationships.The Clinton White House is described as being disorganized, with staff running around in dirty blue jeans and t-shirts, and littered with discarded pizza cartons and fast food wrappers, and staff meetings ending without resolution of any issues. By contrast, the Bushes and Reagans conducted business in more dignified surroundings, the staff more appropriately dressed, and the presidents in a leadership role, seeking and getting the information they need to make decisions--not as a result of polls, but based on what they see as the best interest of the country.Many, many examples are given to give a clear picture of each personality discussed. I've gotten the same impression from other authors writing about the same personalities. When you hear people described similarly by several respected sources, the adage, \"Where there's smoke, there's fire,\" comes to mind.As a consequence, I have developed an image of the Bushes and Ronald Reagan as decent men, with high moral character and the best interest of their country at heart. Lyndon Johnson has left a lasting impression on me as a manipulator of people, somewhat of a megalomaniac who threw his power around, but also always mindful of the best interests of his nation, and battling the long-haired, tie-dyed, pot-smokers-against-the-war. Richard Nixon I see as somewhat of a paranoid personality, and Jimmy Carter I've respected as well-meaning but ineffective as a president. I think his heart was in the right place. Clinton, I have no respect for whatever; I don't think he had any interest but his own at heart. He's the only president, Democrat or Republican, I've ever thought did not hold his country's best interest primary. I often wonder how close to reality we are in judging our leaders. We could go back all the way to Herbert Hoover, but there's not much point.In any case, the critic who referred to this as a \"wretched\" book, I think was guilty of a strictly partisan reaction. I think it is a fine book, edifying and a valuable look at George W. Bush as well as a frank, if brief, appraisal of several other former presidents. Was it \"too kind\" to Bush? I don't think so. I think he really is a high-quality man.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)author of Handguns and Freedom..their care and maintenanceand other books\"}"}]}

Fifteen major league clubs offered him a contract, but it was the Milwaukee Braves who won out, signing Jordan to a $45,000 bonus\u2014one of the largest paid to any new player by the organization\u2014and shipping him off to McCook, Nebraska, to play for their Class D ball club.

I can withstand challenge from without and from within. Am I right, Comrade?\u201d It was August 1974. From a small Oakland-based cell, the Panthers had grown to become a revolutionary national organization, mobilizing black communities and white supporters across the country\u2014but relentlessly targeted by the police and the FBI, and increasingly riven by violence and strife within. How Brown came to a position of power over this paramilitary, male-dominated organization, and what she did with that power, is a riveting, unsparing account of self-discovery. Brown\u2019s story begins with growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in Philadelphia and attending a predominantly white school, where she first sensed what it meant to be black, female, and poor in America. She describes her political awakening during the bohemian years of her adolescence, and her time as a foot soldier for the Panthers, who seemed to hold the promise of redemption. And she tells of her ascent into the upper echelons of Panther leadership: her tumultuous relationship with the charismatic Huey Newton, who would become her lover and her nemesis; her experience with the male power rituals that would sow the seeds of the party's demise; and the scars that she both suffered and inflicted in that era\u2019s paradigm-shifting clashes of sex and power.

I would have read it sooner but I was forced to read \"The Scarlet Letter\" in high school and never had the heart to read another Nathaniel Hawthorne novel.Not expecting much, I have to say I was very impressed with this book. The details got to be a bit much at times. I have to admit there were parts of the book that I scanned quit quickly because I just didn't need to know that much description about a certain thing.That being said, Hawthorne was very good at clearly painting a picture in my head. I could smell the mustiness of the house, feel the joy when Phoebe entered a room, and feel Clifford's sadness and confusion. What took me by surprise was the sharp wit throughout the book and intellectualness of this wit. Quit often I found myself laughing out loud at some of the dry humor in this book. Also of course there was the mystery of the book which kept you hanging on until the end.I don't know that I will read any additional Hawthorne novels but I would recommend this as a good example of his work. It is much more interesting and engaging than the Scarlet Letter.\"}"}]}

It is a model, a framework of what proper, God pleasing prayer is all about.Prayer is not merely about us and our needs of the moment; it is about HIM and HIS WILL. Hank makes the point that the Lord's Prayer starts and ends with God in Heaven, His Kingdom and Gloryand that the purpose of all Christ-honoring prayer is to maximize the glory of the Lord by what we pray, how we pray, the faith/hope we bring to prayer, our expectancy, and how serious we take the two critical factors that end every biblical prayer:&quot;In Jesus' Name&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot;.Prayer is RELATIONSHIP, not just realization of our needs/wants.&quot;Our Father&quot; sets the tone for what true prayer is all about.Hank does a great job in showing that our walk with Christ determines Who our true Father is and how the mutual love relationship plays itself out in the Family of God. It's not what we can get out of God that counts, but what He can get into us of His Spirit and being filled with His love and presence.It's 'Presence' over 'Presents'.Finally, this book is a great corrective to many misunderstoodbeliefs about Prayer of Jabez, for example, which many folks try to use as a formula for blessing rather than a template of a godly life lived in proper relationship with the One we pray to.While God is more eager to bless/grant prayers than we are inclined to ask, we still need to ask aright,putting first things first: Our Father must come first and His will prevail.Why would we want to receive any less than God's best for us?This book will literally revolutionize your prayer life. When we prayerfully draw closer to Abba Father, becoming more Christ-likein the process of a life of prayer, we are filled with the Spiritand find more of our prayers answered as conforming more and moreto His perfect will. When we receive more of the Giver Himself,the gifts/blessings come along as added benefits, but if we focus on the gifts/blessings, we lose out on deeper communion/intimacy with the Giver, the Lover of our souls.Makes an excellent gift and is one of those rare books that should be read multiple times in a year for maximum blessing!\"}"}]}

Delillo's first book is Americana, is that anything like The New Collosus? Sachs' initials also spell BS, who knows if that means anything. What is fun about Leviathan is the great plot twists, and the way the philosophical abstractions add to the suspense. Usually, for me, philosophical digressions weigh down the narrative. Reaing it a second time is fun because Auster foreshadows a lot with symbolism (Aaron's double vision at the bar for example). The female characters are generally weak, except for Maria Turner - who is probably the best character in the book. The male characters are a little charming, but they don't have the self-irony they think they do. They're clever, but not the center of the universe.\"}"}]}

Although he's evidently extremely knowledgeable in a host of subjects, Maugham's chief genius as I perceived it is in his ability to acutely describe how an individual (in this case a sensitive young man named Philip Carey) emotes and reacts to the influence of other people in his life. How do I know that Maugham's portrayal of emotion is accurate? Because I've been there as most of you have.Growing up we've all had our insecurities (or still do): things about us that we were overly sensitive about and wish we could extinguish. For me one of these was my childhood asthma that gave me a tough time in middle school and early high school because it sometimes inconveniently hampered my athletic performance and made me stand out as abnormal. For you it's something else, unless you're one of the tiny minority that sailed through your formative years with *all* associated events and people bolstering your self esteem.For Philip Carey it's his clubfoot (deformed foot) that is his physical and psychlogical burden. It makes him limp ungracefully and hinders his participation in athletics but doesn't cause him any pain. Carey also becomes acutely conscious of any reference to it by other people. Of Human Bondage is partly a story of how Philip is cursed by his clubfoot to become an overly sensitive young man but eventually matures and largely conquers the impact of this birth defect on his self image. One turning point near the end of Philip's maturation process is when he realizes that everyone has a failing whether they're aware of it or not. He's almost thankful that his was just a relatively minor physical failing and feels sorry for those who remain unaware of deficiencies in their personalities that are glaringly obvious to himself.Of Human Bondage is a rather sizable fictional account of Philip's life up to about age 30, but I flew through it in next to no time. You probably will too. I'm not sure how absorbed women would get in this book since it's the story of a man's life, but I highly recommend it to everyone! It's simply one of the greatest classics of the 20th century and will undoubtedly be enjoyed for centuries to come.\"}"}]}

Margaret Mitchell\u2019s page-turning, sweeping American epic has been a classic for over eighty years.

The lovers at the novel\u2019s centre \u2013 the selfish, privileged Scarlett O\u2019Hara and rakish Rhett Butler \u2013 are magnetic: pulling readers into the tangled narrative of a struggle to survive that cannot be forgotten. WINNER OF NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AND PULITZER PRIZE 'For sheer readability I can think of nothing it must give way before' The New Yorker 'What makes some people come through catastrophes and others, apparently just as able, strong, and brave, go under?\u2019 Margaret Mitchell\", \"authors\": \"['Margaret Mitchell']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House\", \"text\" : \"Scarlett O' Hara has to be the most famous character ever written in all of literature. Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it.\"}"}]}

Dead Man\u2019s Walk As young Texas Rangers, Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call--\"Gus\" and \"Call\" for short--have much to learn about survival in a land fraught with perils: not only the blazing heat and raging tornadoes, roiling rivers and merciless Indians, but also the deadly whims of soldiers. On their first expeditions--led by incompetent officers and accompanied by the robust, dauntless whore known as the Great Western--they will face death at the hands of the cunning Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump and the silent Apache Gomez. They will be astonished by the Mexican army. And Gus will meet the love of his life. Comanche Moon Texas Rangers August McCrae and Woodrow Call, now in their middle years, are still figuring out how to deal with the ever-increasing tensions of adult life--Gus with his great love, Clara Forsythe, and Call with Maggie Tilton, the young whore who loves him--when they sign up to pursue the Comanche horse thief Kicking Wolf into Mexico. On this mission their captain, Inish Scull, is captured by the brutally cruel Mexican bandit Ahumado, and Gus and Call must come to the rescue, with the aid of new friends including Joshua Deets, Jake Spoon, and Pea Eye Parker, as well as the renowned Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. Lonesome Dove Gus and Call, now retired from the Texas Rangers and settled in the border town of Lonesome Dove running the Hat Creek Cattle Company, are visited by their old friend Jake Spoon, who convinces Gus and Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them north to Montana in order to start a cattle ranch in untouched territory. Gus is further motivated by a desire to see the love of his life, Clara Allen (nee Forsythe), who now lives with her children and comatose horse-trader husband in Ogallala, Nebraska. On the way to Montana they travel through wild country full of thieves, murderers, and a lifetime's worth of unforgettable adventure. Streets of Laredo Woodrow Call is back in Texas, a Ranger once again and a general gun-for-hire, but increasingly a relic as the westward sprawl of the railroads rapidly settles the once lawless frontier. Hired by a railroad tycoon to hunt down a dangerous bandit named Joey Garza, Call sets out once again with a hapless Yankee named Ned Brookshire who works for the railroad company that hired Call. Call's old friend Pea Eye Parker--who initially refused to join the expedition because of his family--sets off with the Kickapoo tracker Famous Shoes to try to catch up with Call, until he runs into troubles of his own.

The Civil Rights movement was still in its infancy; legal and de facto segregation were the dominant structure governing race relationships, and today's current \"diversity\" in advertising, education, employment and all else, an impossible utopian dream. Not to mention having a President...The novel's central theme was \"too hot to handle\" for the NYC publishing world, but fortunately, like a couple of prominent black writers of the time, Richard Wright and James Baldwin, it found a \"home\" in France, where the French version received strong reviews in \"Le Monde,\" and other French newspapers. Finally, the book was brought back to its country of origin, in English, and publisher by Grove Press, an \"edgy\" publisher of the time, which published, among others, the unexpurgated version of Henry Miller'sTropic of CancerThe storyline covers a weekend in the lives of two individuals, James Cartwright Holland, a 19 year old white college sophomore, and \"Kitten,\" a 14 year old black prostitute. An arrangement that could be used to define the term misalliance. The story is told in alternating chapters, each representing the perspectives of the main protagonists. Gover has a gift of capturing the patois of his characters, which heightens the \"misunderstandings\" that evolve over the weekend. Holland has just received his first semester grades, and that includes three failing ones. He decides that he needs a little \"solace,\" and with the impetus provided by one of his \"frat brothers,\" decides that the local \"cat house\" is the place to reconfirm his virility. Kitten, on the other hand, seems far too astute and wise for her 14 years, perhaps as a result of growing up without a childhood. Her \"sorority sisters,\" well, of sorts, have instructed her on the importance of identifying potential \"investments,' i.e., wealth clients, and with the wad of cash that Holland has in his pocket, she assumes he will be her \"mark.\" And yes, the 100 bucks is the going rate for an entire weekend with her \"investment.\"In terms of the patois, consider from Kitten: \"...he standin there wiff a lil old h***, lookin roun read dum. Gee-zuz! How dum kin one Whitboy git?\"I first read this book in the early `60's, and decided on a re-read. Both times I was impressed with how Gover seemed to capture, in a low-key way, the stunning racial hypocrisy of the time. Holland is constantly proclaiming that he is not prejudiced, and not a prude, even though the dialogue reveals how he is. Of course, he has a girlfriend, wife-to-be, that he \"respects\" too much to engage in any...On the re-read however, I was also struck by the \"fairy tale\" aspect of the novel. The downside of these relationships was certainly glossed over, if not completely omitted, and the essence of the power relationship, well, perhaps I should just say that, like in a fairy tale, there was a happy ending for the underdog, and the obtuse college kid got his \"comeuppance.\" There were also a couple other unrealistic aspects to the tale.Gover's own review at Amazon should definitely be read. He is still with us, but his copyright for this book has been taken by an unscrupulous publisher so if you intend to buy this, please make sure what version you are acquiring.So, if you are willing to suspend some disbelief, or let's say, using a more modern expression, willing to accept some \"magic realism,\" and would like to enjoy a humorous social satire on \"the way we were,\" or, perhaps still are, then I'd strongly recommend this book. 5-stars.\"}"}]}

Three others that come instantly to mind are those by Jonathan Schell,The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People, William Greider,The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy, and E.O. Wilson,The Future of Life.This book is not an easy read. The author, a Professor of Law in the University of Cambridge, wrote an earlier work,Eunomia: New Order for a New World, that has remained similar obscure, and that is a pity, for what I see here is a truly brilliant mind able to suggest that the Congress of Vienna, the current law of nations, and the de-humanization of state to state relations, isolating the internal affairs and inhumanities of state from global public morality and indignation, are the greatest travesty in human history.The author joins William Greider in suggesting that the state as a corporate personality is as immoral (and irrational in terms of natural law) as is the corporate personality that allows corporations to treat humans as \"goods.\" In this book the author sets out to do nothing less than logically overturn centuries of absolutist amoral power institutionalized by elites in the form of state governments with sovereign rights divorced from and with eminent domain over their subjects (vice citizens), and to propose a new form of globalized human society that restores the human aspect to relations among peoples and among nations of peoples.This is a book that requires patience. It must be slowly and methodically absorbed. The footnotes are quite extraordinary, as is the summative and explicatory survey of many different literatures over many different historical periods.The author is critical of universities for failing to develop the public mind, and offers a lovely exposition of how sanity, insanity, and public consciousness are all subject to the mythology of capitalism and the manipulation of the elites--in this he would find fellow travelers (smile) in Chomsky and Vidal. He concludes that diplomacy (and statecraft) as an articulation of the public mind and public interest have *failed*, and looks instead to some sort of social re-ordering from the bottom up.This book, apart from offering an enlightened vision of the law as a living thing able to encapsulate changes morality and changing interests among parties, does nothing less than reconceptualize international relations. This author is to the law of nations what Vaclav Havel was to communism.He touches on a point Henry Kissinger makes in the last of his books I reviewed (Does America Need a Foreign Policy? : Toward a Diplomacy for the 21st Century), and specifically that \"The risk now facing humanity is the globalizing of the all-powerful, all-consuming social systems, without the moral, legal, political and cultural aspirations and constraints, such as they are, which moderate social action at the national level.\" The world, in essence, has become much too complex and much too volatile and much too dangerous for archaic state-level forms of mandarin governance.In the middle of the book, the author's review of how Germany previously collapsed into a patchwork of insignificant nations sounds all too much like the United States of America, where citizenship is losing its value, tyrannical minorities are in isolation from one another (and from reality), and the sense of national identity is too easily captured by a handful of neo-conservatives (modern Nazis). Interestingly, as with Havel, he notes the importance of art and culture as a means of synthesizing national identity, and would probably agree with E.O. Wilson (\"Consilience\") as to the humanities being vital to the context and conduct of the sciences. His list of national \"diseases\" is both disturbing and timely.He joins Jefferson and the founding fathers in focusing on the health and happiness of the people as the ultimate organizing principle (some would translate \"happiness\" as \"fulfillment\", a more accomplished and less frivolous objective).On page 137 he is quite clear in suggesting that capitalism as it is practiced today, is nothing less than a form of totalitarianism, and he goes on to say on page 139 that social evil is the greatest challenge facing humanity today. Instead of socializing individuals into the reduced status of \"goods\" we should be socializing the state into a representative and general democracy by rehumanizing humanity and rehumanizing the organizations that are supposed to provide collective voice to the people.In following pages the author provides a brilliant catalog of the ills of democracy, reconceptualizes democracy as being based on the rule of law (for all) rather than on who rules (for the benefit of the few), and he explicitly condemns the largely unaccountable forms of concentrated power (by which we take to mean the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and other devices for perpetuating immoral capitalism irrespective of local needs).The full force of the author's thinking comes into full stride in the concluding portions of the book as he integrates new concepts of international law, history, social relations, and new forms of intergovernmental relations truly representative of the species as a whole and the people as a moral force. He laments the manner in which an extraordinarily global elite has been able to \"separate\" people from morality and from one another, leading to a common acceptance of five intolerable things: 1) unequal social development; 2) war and armaments; 3) governmental oppression; 4) physical degradation; and 5) spiritual degradation.The author concludes by proposing a new view of the human world, and his remarks must be read in the original. He ends, as do Will and Ariel Durant in their summative \"The Lessons of History,\" by noting that the necessary revolution is that which must take place in our minds, not on the streets.\"This is an utterly brilliant book that has been badly marketed and is grossly under-appreciated, even by the so-called intelligencia. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to cast off their slave clothes, stop being a drone, and live free.More recent books that fully validate this superb work, with reviews:Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on DemocracyThe Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About ItRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About ItGlobal Assemblages: Technology, Politics, and Ethics as Anthropological ProblemsA Power Governments Cannot Suppress\"}"}]}

This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.I looked over other possibilities as a basic textbook for an introductory mythology course, but I keep coming back to this one. If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of virtually every tale of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list.\"}"}]}

Much of the book centers on the 19th century, when the Rockies were first being explored and settled -- if that's the word for it -- by Anglos; though men like Pike, Fremont, and Hayden are mentioned, most of the focus is on the trappers and \"mountain men\" rather than the official explorers and surveyors. Instead of very much about the mining days 100+ years ago we get much on the health mecca and dude ranch aspects. And while there are plently of colorful characters, it isn't *that* sort of a book. Only the last two (short) chapters cover the time after World War II.So to me it seemed like a somewhat random walk that I wouldn't have thought to take on my own. If there had been some great new theme(s) or revelation(s) which resulted from Ferguson's rambles I might have liked the book more. But I was left with wondering why he chose to focus on the somewhat unusual or off-beat subjects that he did. Oh well, at least it was something kinda different.\"}"}]}

Highly recommended.\"\u2014Library Journal (starred review) In this gorgeously written and spellbinding historical novel based on Pride and Prejudice, the author of The Clergyman\u2019s Wife combines the knowing eye of Jane Austen with the eroticism and Gothic intrigue of Sarah Waters to reimagine the life of the mysterious Anne de Bourgh. As a fussy baby, Anne de Bourgh was prescribed laudanum to quiet her, and now the young woman must take the opium-heavy tincture every day. Growing up sheltered and confined, removed from sunshine and fresh air, the pale and overly slender Anne grew up with few companions except her cousins, including Fitzwilliam Darcy. Throughout their childhoods, it was understood that Darcy and Anne would marry and combine their vast estates of Pemberley and Rosings. But Darcy does not love Anne or want her. After her father dies unexpectedly, leaving her his vast fortune, Anne has a moment of clarity: what if her life of fragility and illness isn\u2019t truly real? What if she could free herself from the medicine that clouds her sharp mind and leaves her body weak and lethargic? Might there be a better life without the medicine she has been told she cannot live without? In a frenzy of desperation, Anne discards her laudanum and flees to the London home of her cousin, Colonel John Fitzwilliam, who helps her through her painful recovery. Yet once she returns to health, new challenges await. Shy and utterly inexperienced, the wealthy heiress must forge a new identity for herself, learning to navigate a \u201cseason\u201d in society and the complexities of love and passion. The once wan, passive Anne gives way to a braver woman with a keen edge\u2014leading to a powerful reckoning with the domineering mother determined to control Anne\u2019s fortune . . . and her life. An extraordinary tale of one woman\u2019s liberation, The Heiress reveals both the darkness and light in Austen\u2019s world, with wit, sensuality, and a deeply compassionate understanding of the human heart.\", \"authors\": \"['Molly Greeley']\", \"publisher\" : \"HarperCollins\", \"text\" : \"This book is great.

But there\u2019s a provocative twist. Cal, the narrator -- also Callie -- is a hermaphrodite. And the explanation for this takes us spooling back in time, through a breathtaking review of the twentieth century, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie\u2019s grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set our narrator\u2019s life in motion. Middlesex is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It\u2019s a brilliant exploration of divided people, divided families, divided cities and nations -- the connected halves that make up ourselves and our world.\", \"authors\": \"['Jeffrey Eugenides']\", \"publisher\" : \"Vintage Canada\", \"text\" : \"In Middlesex, Calliope Stephanides relays his family history with cinematic tableaux.His Greek grandparents, Lefty and Desdemona (love that name!), lost their parents at a young age. Growing up together, they were always close, often feeling as though they were the same person. Their romance budded when Lefty attempted to choose a wife among the two eligible bachelorettes in the village. He couldn't imagine himself being married to either one or leaving his sister. Together brother and sister fled the Turkish invasion in Greece and got married on the boat bound for America. Their incestuous romance haunted them throughout their lives and continues to secretly haunt their offspring.Unknowingly, they carried a recessive gene that causes 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. When their son, Milton, marries his first cousin, Tessie, consanguinity finally forces the gene to a dominant position in Milton and Tessie's second child, Calliope. Born Callie, he goes through the first 14 years of his life as a female. It is only when he ends up in the hospital for unrelated injuries that Calliope learns that there is something different about him: he is biologically a male, but his genitalia doesn't reflect that fact.At 14, Cal strikes out on his own; he runs away from his family and begins a year of living on the streets and exploiting his body in order to survive. Middlesex is a truly fascinating study of human nature, gender, and sexual discovery. As the narrator, Cal oscillates between numerous core narratives: his grandparents' history, his parent's history, his own story of changing from Callie to Cal, and how he gets along today as a 40-year-old hermaphrodite. In each of these narratives Cal assumes the voice and point of view of multiple characters with surprising finesse.My only complaint is that parts of it dragged-there were times when I thought that's enough with the history lesson! But overall it was a great read, the ending was one of the best that I've read in a while.\"}"}]}

The World\u2019s Greatest Battleships features 52 of the greatest warships to have sailed and fought in the last 500 years. Beginning with English king Henry VIII\u2019s flagship, Henry Grace \u00e0 Dieu, the book covers all the main periods of battleship development, including the great sail ships, such as Sovereign of the Seas, Santissima Trinidad and HMS Victory. The advent of steam-driven warships provide the core of the book, beginning with the introduction of Gloire in 1859, and continuing through all the major pre-Dreadnoughts, such as Inflexible, Mikasa, Maine and Tsessarevitch. The author continues with detailed coverage of the great battleships of the two world wars, including Derfflinger, Nagato, Hood, Scharnhorst, Vittorio Veneto, Yamato and Iowa.

Each entry includes a brief description of the battleship\u2019s development and history, a profile view, key features and specifications.

Along the way, magical experiences with his zany friends, his first love, and even a maniacal bully keep James from the road to emotional destruction. Will they be enough to revive the passion and hope that James once had, or will he slip further into the shadows of summer?\", \"authors\": \"['Jonathan Zemsky']\", \"publisher\" : \"Infinity Publishing\", \"text\" : \"Over a ten day period during the summer of 1955, fourteen-year-old James Sayer learns a lot about friendship, racism, family, death, and how forgiveness always comes at a price.It's been over a year since James's younger brother, Brand, died. Brand suffered from a rare blood disease, and everyone knew that he probably wouldn't grow into adulthood. But Brand didn't die from his disease, at least not directly, and although no one else seems to blame James for his brother's passing, he certainly blames himself. His beloved brother's death has left a hole in his heart, and he's not the same happy-go-lucky teen that he once was. He no longer has any interest in baseball, which was an activity that he and his brother shared together. Drawing, another shared interest, has been pushed by the wayside, abandoned.Until James gets a job working at the fair for the summer alongside his friend Costello, serving ice cream at Mr. Curren's stand. Along with their other friends, G-Man and Fizz, James hopes to spend the summer working hard, avoiding the baseball games that he'll inevitably be asked to join, and staying out of trouble.Unfortunately, that doesn't work out as well as he'd planned.First, there are girls. Namely, a girl named Paige, who he can't seem to get enough of, even though she irritates him constantly. Then there's G-Man and the girl he loves, Marie, which causes tons of trouble since G-Man is black and Maria is white. Then there's the group of bullies in town, led by Black-Eye, who likes to make trouble anywhere he can find it.Slowly, though, James finds these strange days of summer changing everything he knows about life and love, of tolerance and diversity, and of blame and forgiveness. For James, these ten days during 1955 might just be the turning point that he's been waiting for.Author Jonathan Zemsky has penned an emotional story that will take you back to the past, when tensions ran high and going to the fair was the highlight of any young boy's summer. With the sounds of baseball all around you and the smell of the fairgrounds drifting in the air, BEYOND THE SHADOWS OF SUMMER is a sweet, sentimental read that you're guaranteed to enjoy.Reviewed by: Jennifer Wardrip, aka \"The Genius\"\"}"}]}

Orwell shows knowledge of his subject, not settling for vague inferences and over-obvious dichotomies.

Unlike many travel guides, offering the same fare but in a somewhat distant (and often boring) fashion, this guide transports you to the destination, awakening your adventurous spirit and enthralling your inner traveler. The many wonderful places described in this guide beg to be visited.However, I found the repetition of various facts and figures (in some case mentioned at least a dozen times with identical phrasing) slightly tiresome. Furthermore the guide's focus on, what I consider to be, higher end travel is somewhat frustrating for the budget conscious (perhaps in my case obsessed) traveller. And, finally, though it is by far the most interesting guide on Japan it is nowhere near as extensive (in terms of locations, directions and general facts) as the Lonely Planet series.Overall, a great read! Though perhaps (if you're looking for extensive travel options) it would be a good idea to purchase a additional travel guide to give you more ideas and a more rounded view.\"}"}]}

In the final decades of the nineteenth century, three brilliant and visionary titans of America\u2019s Gilded Age\u2014Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse\u2014battled bitterly as each vied to create a vast and powerful electrical empire. In Empires of Light, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation\u2019s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world\u2019s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World\u2019s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber\u2014Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair.\", \"authors\": \"['Jill Jonnes']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House Trade Paperbacks\", \"text\" : \"PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE POOR REVIEW FROM johnjones2! I will base my review of this book based on his ridiculous 2 star review. I have been an Electrical Engineer since the mid-1980s. I enjoyed this book tremendously! This is a book that deals with the history of the THREE PRIMARY men who began the war of AC vs. DC electric currents. They are Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla.Apparently reviewer johnjones2 does not know his history. Charles Proteus Steinmetz never worked for Westinghouse; he worked for GE (that's common knowledge). He didn't join the GE staff until 1893, which was the year of the Colombian Exposition in Chicago. The war of electric currents was well under way before Steinmetz ever joined the GE staff. As you'll learn in this book (and others), the Colombian Exposition was a major battle ground for the war of electric currents. Steinmetz was an outstanding electrical engineer who later worked (for GE) to help optimize the AC motor by solving hysteresis issues. It was TESLA'S (who began working for Westinghouse in 1888 after a short stint with Edison), NOT Steinmetz's, ALL-IMPORTANT PATENTS that were needed to get the AC business going. That's the way business works! This book is about how the AC / DC war began and how AC proved to be the better technology (that's why our homes are now wired for AC). It's not about how AC systems were later perfected.Am I bothered that the author didn't mention Steinmetz - heck no. There are many other engineers who have worked on AC systems to make them better and more efficient, did I expect all of them to be mentioned in this book as well - again, heck no! For reviewer johnjones2 to say that the author had ulterior motives for leaving out Steinmetz is completely hilarious!In 1889, Steinmetz had to flee Germany because of his SOCIALIST activities (ulterior motive?), he then came to the United States. Rudolf Eickemeyer, who had begun building electrical apparatus in his factory in Yonkers, N.Y., gave Steinmetz his start in electrical engineering research. When GE bought out Eickemeyer in late 1892, Steinmetz remained on the staff and began working under the new owners.Now lets move on to reviewer johnjones2's technical issues. Really, there are none. The author does a good job setting the groundwork for how scientists began studying and discovering the basics of electricity and how that knowledge was developed so that man could harness the powerof electricity and use it in the way that we use it today. The so-called technical errors that are pointed out by johnjones2 are based on very trivial issues. I found his complaints about the authors \"scientific drawings\" completely off base and without merit. The author provides 11 diagrams and basic electrical schematics that help give the average reader an idea of the concepts involved. They are very basic in nature and are diagrams that are still used today to help explain the fundamentals of electricity. These are not \"misleading\" in any way. When reviewer johnjones2 complains about the author rating electrical generators in horsepower and says \"something that certainly hasn't been done for a century\", well, I think he missed the point. This book is about the history of AC/DC electricity and how it was developed a CENTURY ago.Lastly, as far as johnjones2's comment \"she (the author) specifies early systems by the number of bulbs they could light-- as if all light bulbs had the same power consumption (but perhaps they did in the earliest days)\", what an ambiguous statement. This one's not even worth the time.This is an excellent book written by a historian, not an Electrical Engineer (can you imagine how boring this book would have been if an Electrical Engineer had written it). This book is a good read for anyone and especially those who love reading about the Gilded Age era of American history.\"}"}]}

Some stories are spot-on, they story is well-written and fleshed out enough to be an understandable short story and also has those \"creepy\" moments I talked about before. Some stories sounded promising, but fell a little short. Then there was one or two that didn't have anything, except maybe good grammar. I have to say that Neil Gaiman's story, \"Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire\" was as good as I expected it to be. Gaiman's an incredible writer and he delivered in this as well. I think the story I was most disappointed with was Gregory Maguire's \"The Prank\". It was definitely not the worst, but I'm a huge fan of his and I thought he could have done a little better.Overall, I'd recommend this as a good book to curl up with on the couch under the soft light of a table lamp late at night. I'd say this is \"Halloween-creepy\" - based on horror, but a little too commercial and kiddy to be truly scary.\"}"}]}

In dat boek volgen we de zussen Alcott, die losjes zijn gebaseerd op de schrijfster zelf en haar drie zussen. In Op eigen wieken zijn de jonge zussen uit het eerste deel opgegroeid. De kwesties waar ze mee worstelen hebben nu een ander karakter dan in hun kindertijd, en elk op hun eigen manier gaan de zussen om met het vinden van werk, een partner en het krijgen van kinderen. Na Op eigen wieken volgen nog twee delen over de levens van de familie Alcott. Het verhaal is vele malen verfilmd en op de planken gebracht. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) schreef ook voor volwassenen, maar had vooral veel succes als schrijfster van kinderboeken. Haar bekendste werk is Little Women, een autobiografische roman die nog twee vervolgboeken kreeg, en talloze malen bewerkt is tot toneelstukken en films. Alcott was ook politiek zeer actief en maakte zich onder andere sterk voor vrouwenrechten en afschaffing van de slavernij.\", \"authors\": \"['Louisa May Alcott']\", \"publisher\" : \"Lindhardt og Ringhof\", \"text\" : \"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys.\"}"}]}

Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the \u201cAustrian School,\u201d which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist.

Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt\u2019s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong \u2014 and strongly reasoned \u2014 anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.\", \"authors\": \"['Henry Hazlitt']\", \"publisher\" : \"Currency\", \"text\" : \"\"Economic In One Lesson\" is a great way to learn the basic principles of Economics.

Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.

Through the vivid metaphor of stone-collecting, the author weaves a complex story full of uncertainties, unanswered questions, and graphic images that lead the novel to a powerful conclusion--which, unlike the finales of many Japanese novels, leaves the reader with a sense of hope.\"}"}]}

At some level, \"Father's Touch\" brings home the horror and repercussions of parental sexual abuse of children to all who read it. One thing I found really disturbing, although not surprising, is how the religious community to which the D'Haene family belonged, the judge who handled his mother's divorce case and others did nothing even after they learned of these horrendous crimes. It seems to reflect that society at large would often rather shove matters like this under the rug and hope they go away rather than deal with them head on.

In Uncas: First of the Mohegans, Michael Leroy Oberg integrates the life story of an important Native American sachem into the broader story of European settlement in America. The arrival of the English in Connecticut in the 1630s upset the established balance among the region's native groups and brought rapid economic and social change. Oberg argues that Uncas's methodical and sustained strategies for adapting to these changes made him the most influential Native American leader in colonial New England.Emerging from the damage wrought by epidemic disease and English violence, Uncas transformed the Mohegans from a small community along the banks of the Thames River in Connecticut into a regional power in southern New England. Uncas learned quickly how to negotiate between cultures in the conflicts that developed as natives and newcomers, Indians and English, maneuvered for access to and control of frontier resources. With English assistance, Uncas survived numerous assaults and plots hatched by his native rivals.Unique among Indian leaders in early America, Uncas maintained his power over large numbers of tributary and other native communities in the region, lived a long life, and died a peaceful death (without converting to Christianity) in his people's traditional homeland. Oberg finds that although the colonists considered Uncas a friend to the English, he was first and foremost an assertive guardian of Mohegan interests.\", \"authors\": \"['Michael Leroy Oberg']\", \"publisher\" : \"Cornell University Press\", \"text\" : \"This book is a must for those who want to understand the history of Connecticut.\"}"}]}

She is one of the grande dames of tarot scholarship and teaching, with over 40 years of experience. On the surface, this may look like a lot of pretty pictures and not much more. However, she covers the mystic traditions that gave rise to the tarot in addition to the history of tarot as a game. She explains how the Kabbalah and Astrology relate to it as well as a number of uses for a tarot deck/reading. She describes the meanings of the number cards, courts and suits as well as the Major Arcana. True, some of this may be beginner's level stuff but I like the approach better than the idea of trying to memorize the meaning of each card. For example, when you get an Ace, knowing that it represents the basic quality of the suit (such as cups), and a special kind of energy, it is way easier than wracking your brain, thinking \"Uh, Ace of Cups...what does that mean again?\"One reviewer commented on not liking the number of different decks pictured but I think that's a good thing. Maybe one type of imagery will spark your thinking better than another. After all, there are probably a couple of hundred different decks out there and we should be able to enjoy and understand as many as we wish.\"}"}]}

The corrupt leaders govern by oppression, but technological resources run low and the knowledge of how to replace them is lost in the mists of time. Instead, the power-hungry leaders turn to sorcery of the blackest kind, kindled by pain and despair.

I was ready to count this among my favorite books. There are 500 pages in the book, and at least the middle 400 or so are fantastic. Others have summarized the plot, so I'm not doing that here. I've been on a stint of fantasy for the past year, and I have to say that this was the most creative book. It got me wondering about how myths are born, how real can they be made, and what powers might humankind discover were we wiped out and forced to start again.However, at the end, at what is supposed to be one of the culminating points of the story, we get preached to for page after page. I have my own spiritual take on life, and I'm glad to learn and borrow from the views of others, but at the end of this book Tepper manages to turn the entire story into a particular present-day religious point of view. I had the sense of mankind evolving into something new throughout the book, but at the end I felt like I had a modern-day missionary at my door.For me this book is about what we humans can discover about ourselves and about the power of myth in human motivation, but only because I reject Tepper's own culminating exposition. Even so, I feel like the story wrapped up nicely, unlike most of the books I've read this year.\"}"}]}

Lady Julia Carrington's husband worked as a spy for the Brits. When he was killed three years before, she was told it had nothing to do with his work, but was a simple robbery. She never truly accepted the verdict, because they only thing they took was a special ring she had given him. Therefore, she is upset when a former comrade of her husband's sends word the ring has finally turned up on the hand of Nicholas Chandler, Viscount Thayne. She is so disturbed she arranges to play cards with him trying to win information. Only, she finds him in a lousy mood, so she falls to play B - kidnaps him. Her abduction is foiled when men paid to act as Highwaymen tried to steal the ring. Julia pulls a pistol and Thayne jumps before her to save her from being shot.She takes him home and nurses him, but soon wishes Thayne gone because she feels an attraction to him. To cover for her tending Thayne, she is sent to London, but there she is determined to press the issue of the ring. Someone is resolute in getting the ring back. Julia is pushed in the path of carriages; Thayne is knocked out when trying to find out information about the ring. Thayne is asking questions about Julia's husband's murder and someone wants it stopped.Julia's neighbour Lord George is determined to put the cat in the pigeons by starting enough gossip about Thayne and Julia to force an engagement.

If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.' - Small ad in the New York Review of Books Jane Juska placed her ad in the New York Times and the response was overwhelming. She took a sabbatical from teaching just to have time to respond and meet some of the men - the result is this engaging, funny and utterly frank account of her exploits. It's high time someone revealed the fact that older single people are as eager for sex and intimacy as their younger counterparts. Jane Juska's brave and honest memoir raises eyebrows and blood pressure in what is undoubtedly an inspiring account of one woman's daring adventures in sex and romance.\", \"authors\": \"['Jane Juska']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House\", \"text\" : \"As a woman of a \"certain age,\" I know exactly what Jane Juska was up against: the Rules of Sexual Behavior that (even into the early 1960's) were ingrained into any woman with a proper upbringing. To wit:1. Women don't enjoy sex.2. Men think of nothing else.3. Get him to marry you by promising him sex, but don't deliver until you're married.4. Sex is for making babies.5. Once you're past making babies, you have no further use for sex.Juska didn't conform to 1., so she flunked 3. and landed, first in a loveless shotgun marriage, then in impecunious single (and celibate) parenthood. Finally, at age 66, when 5. proved to be inapplicable to her too, she decided to catch up on what she'd been missing, and this book documents the results.Juska is a terrific writer, funny, frank, and engaging. She doesn't idealize herself: she's an effective teacher but a less-than-perfect mother; she spent many years overweight, unfit, and with a serious drinking problem; and she regularly puts her foot in her mouth, often with hilarious results. But she's courageous (anyone who teaches at San Quentin is a candidate for sainthood in my book), and when she commits herself to something (or someone) she follows through.Having a fair amount of experience myself with middle-aged dating, I found Juska's adventures horrifically believable. (The men our age, after all, were raised with the Rules too.) But she's resilient, good-humored, and willing to take each man she meets on his own terms; she enjoys the experience fully, even if it proves to be short-lived. She observes wryly, near the end of the book, that most of the men she met were trying to prove something to *themselves* by having sex with her; by contrast, she approaches each new encounter with an open mind, and is hurt more than once when a man turns out to have a hidden agenda.I wasn't surprised that her most gratifying relationship was with a man in his 30's -- he doesn't have the same prejudices and preconceptions as the men her age. And, I think, the fact that it's an \"impossible\" relationship is liberating: they have no expectations to fulfill, so they're free to enjoy their encounters without feeling obliged to have weighty discussions about Our Future.I enjoyed the book thoroughly, and would recommend it to almost any adult, but especially to two sets of readers: (1) middle-aged women as an example of what can happen if you set out to be, fully and frankly, yourself; and (2) middle-aged men, as an education in what's out there if you abandon your stereotypes and take an honest look at the women your age.\"}"}]}

Unfortunately, history such as that presented in this work has only started to trickle into the mainstream. Regardless of the fact that the vast majority of East European ethnic Germans discussed here had no connections with or sympathy for the political establishment of the state of Germany during World War II, the problem is that much of what has been associated with Germany in subsequent years is tied to the fact that Germany lost the war to the Allies. While I highly recommend \"Barefoot in the Rubble\" and \"German Boy\" (see my reviews for these books), the difference with this work is that it lays out much of the history behind the ethnic cleansing of East European Germans. In addition, rather than focusing on a single individual or a small group of individuals, \"A Terrible Revenge\" shares dozens of accounts, including excerpts from official reports, along with footnotes. In addition, the appendix to this book shares high-level quantitative population tabulations for the 1939 to 1950 time period that help underscore the great losses of ethnic Germans outside of Germany. A warning to those who are considering to read this book: many horrors of life during the five year period following World War II are shared, including vivid accounts of rapes and the manners in which individuals were murdered by the hoards of Soviet armies that descended upon the Germans of East Europe. While my initial interest in reading this text revolved around its discussion of Donauschwabens (Danube Swabians), many more ethnic Germans were affected. About 15 million found themselves on the wrong side of the new postwar borders within Europe. For readers who are unfamiliar with this part of history, please bear in mind that in no way is \"A Terrible Revenge\" unsympathetic to other populations affected by World War II and its aftermath. The introduction to this work presents 6 considerations, which include: \"all victims of war and tyranny deserve respect and compassion\", \"the expulsion of the Germans is a legitimate subject for scholarly research\", \"historians are bound by a scholarly and moral obligation to research and present historical events, to determine the facts and organize them into the greater historical context\", \"the expulsion cannot be regarded as a question of crime and punishment\", \"a principle of collective guilt cannot be applied to the expulsions, just as there can be no collective guilt for war\", and \"the tragic experience of the German expellees could have served as a warning to spare other nations the traumata of expulsion from homeland, heritage, and pride\". With this last consideration, the author notes that: \"Alas, for decades the facts of the expulsion of the Germans were systematically ignored by the media and even by professional historians, whose function was and remains to do proper research, to chronicle events and to put them in perspective. No wonder that the ethnic cleansing of the 1990's in the former Yugoslavia was presented by the media as unprecedented. The expulsion and spoliation of the Germans remains an important subject for study in the high schools and universities. We owe this recognition to the victims - as we owe the truth to ourselves.\"\"}"}]}

Gist for the mill jumped off headlines in major metropolitan dailies and out of Joseph McCarthy inebriated mind.In the hands of a good story teller, a master spy could reasonably navigate his way through Moscow without drawing more attention than a single match stick in a generic and unmarked book.But, these days, trying to have an American go incognito in Damascus would be like try to slip vodka into James Bonds's martini. You are just going to set off some alarm bells. From the spy novel perspective, the new world order doesn't lend itself to the kind of deception we appreciate. la Carre, like many of the old masters, has struggled in this new world. In his newer work, he makes good movie but lame novels.But, it's still a good time to read his early stuff, when spies were spies and the Soviets weren't trying to be like us. His leading man are lumpy and flawed, never to be played by Sean Connery or Clive Owen. Instead, think of Ricky Gervais, if he took a serious turn, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman, though like a good spy he can do anything so it's not really fair to cite him, but you get the picture.In the Spy Who Came in from the Cold, la Carre's breakout novel, the leading figure is old, fatigued and miserable. Alec Leamas spent a life lying to his closest associates, mistrusting the motives of others and wearing a secret face, leaving him alone and in cold comfort as his usefulness as an agent comes to an end. Packed with this emotional wreckage, Leamas accepts one more assignment before he can come in from the cold to finish a career that has ended sourly.It's impossible to do the plot justice without spoiling the novel's conclusion, but there is a reason Time Magazine rated it one of the top novels of all time and Publisher's Weekly called it the greatest spy novel ever. As with many great novels, sometimes a great plot and strong story telling can obscure a deeper message. So it is with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. la Carre has a lot say about the morality of spying, why we do it, who it benefits and who it hurts. His characters, presented as archetypes, are fully fleshed with quirks and humanity. There are no cardboard cutouts here. No short cuts in character development. Yet, in each character we see more than a person, we see a class of people, or should see it anyway and the whole package paints an ugly picture.The Cold War is gone. We won that one without firing a shot, through as a result we have the greatest and most expensive military in the world. The military, like la Carre's early spy novels, may be bit dated, built for a world left behind and unmissed, but that does not mean that we can't admire the majesty and the power.\"}"}]}

There is an underlying sense of \"wrongness\" within these pages disguised as a rather straightforward tale. I read this novel in one sitting and it kept me riveted to my seat.Other reviewers have commented upon the lack of \"closure\" in some of the plotlines. From my perspective, the terror of the unknown and leaving the horrors unsolved made for a more realistic and true-to-life ending. Certainly in \"real life\" there are not too many times when events wrap up in a neat little package. H.P.

When I use the word trauma, I am talking here about the often debilitating symptoms that many people suffer from in the aftermath of perceived life-threatening or overwhelming experiences. Recently, trauma has been used as a buzzword to replace everyday stress, as in, \u201cI had a traumatic day at work.\u201d However, this use is completely misleading. While it is true that all traumatic events are stressful, all stressful events are not traumatic. Unique to Each Individual When it comes to trauma, no two people are exactly alike. What proves harmful over the long term to one person may be exhilarating to another. There are many factors involved in the wide range of response to threat. These responses depend upon genetic make-up, an individual\u2019s history of trauma, even his or her family dynamics. It is vital that we appreciate these differences. Simply knowing that certain kinds of early childhood experiences can severely diminish our ability to cope and be present in the world may elicit compassion and support rather than harsh judgment, both for ourselves and for others. Perhaps the most important thing I have learned about trauma is that people, especially children, can be overwhelmed by what we usually think of as common everyday events. Until recently, our understanding of trauma was limited to \u201cshell-shocked\u201d soldiers who have been devastated by war, victims of severe abuse or violence, and those who have suffered catastrophic accidents and injuries. This narrow view could not be further from the truth. The fact is that, over time, a series of seemingly minor mishaps can have a damaging effect on a person. Trauma does not have to stem from a major catastrophe. Some common triggering events include: \u2022 Automobile accidents (even fender benders) \u2022 Routine invasive medical procedures \u2022 Loss of loved ones \u2022 Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes Even falling off a bicycle can be overwhelming to a child under certain circumstances. We will discuss those circumstances later. For now, I will simply say that almost all of us have experienced some form of trauma, either directly or indirectly.\", \"authors\": \"['Peter A.

When Bagoas is very young, his father is murdered and he is sold as a slave to King Darius of Persia. Then, when Alexander conquers the land, he is given Bagoas as a gift, and the boy is besotted. This passion comes at a time when much is at stake\u2014Alexander has two wives, conflicts are ablaze, and plots on the Macedon king\u2019s life abound. The result is a riveting account of a great conqueror\u2019s years of triumph and, ultimately, heartbreak. The Persian Boy is the second volume of the Novels of Alexander the Great trilogy, which also includes Fire from Heaven and Funeral Games. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Mary Renault including rare images of the author. \u201cMary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us. She shows us their strangeness; discerning, sure-footed, challenging our values, piquing our curiosity, she leads us through an alien landscape that moves and delights us.\u201d \u2014Hilary Mantel\", \"authors\": \"['Mary Renault']\", \"publisher\" : \"Open Road Media\", \"text\" : \"Robert Lipsyte, who wrote some wonderful novels himself, said in a column that his father gave him this book to read one weekend. After putting it off, he finally gave in and was hooked from the first sentence. Mary Renault casts a spell from the first in \"The Persian Boy\", the pivot of her Alexandriad.Bagoas is born into an aristocratic family; the turmoil following the death of King Ochos claims his father, mother and sisters, and he himself is castrated and sold at the age of 10. The twin horrors are followed in time by another; Bagoas is himself sold by his master to other men as a prostitute. Procured for King Darius, Bagoas's lot changes only slightly; instead of being sold to many men, he is kept by one man, a King he holds in awe for his station, and not out of personal admiration.Darius has made the mistake of underestimating the young Macedonian King Alexander, who at 20 undertakes the reconquest of Greek cities in Asia Minor. But Alexander closes in on the Persian Empire, and Darius suffers one defeat after another until his own warlords lose faith in him. When a coup sees Darius taken prisoner, Bagoas escapes with only his life. In time he is rescued by one of those warlords, who decides to beg Alexander for clemency. Who does he bring to sweeten the plea? Bagoas--as a gift.Alexander is presented by Renault as a man capable of more than mortal feats who is still reassuringly human--more than that, he needs love desperately, from the hero-worship of the soldiers who follow him to the intimate devotion of his lover Hephaistion. Bagoas has never known love at all, only use. When Macedonian King and Persian courtesan meet, the inevitable happens--and this is where the enchantment begins.Renault's mastery is impeccable. With a few well-chosen words, she conjures the images of the great Persian palaces--the ruins at Persepolis, Susa, Ekbatana, and Babylon; she recreates the travels of the Macedonian army so well that any reader who picks up her companion book \"The Nature of Alexander\" will look at the pictures and exclaim, \"I know this! This is--\" and name the very scene. But it is her characters that truly live. Bagoas is keenly intelligent, charming, courtly, sarcastic, prey to jealousy and possessiveness when it comes to his lover; his growing maturity merely adds to the pain he experiences as the affair and Alexander's conquests progress. And Alexander is much more accessible here than in \"Fire From Heaven,\" which is a wonderful book but presents Alexander as all light and no fire. Here we get to see Alexander as preening boy, heroic warrior, pragmatic king, and devoted lover. It is a marvelous love story whether or not it actually happened.But the emotional payoffs of the affair are balanced by hideous tragedies, none more affecting than the death of Hephaistion. Bagoas' quiet desperation to keep Alexander with the sane and living is agonizing with the knowledge that Alexander did not survive his lover by more than three months. Renault foreshadows without laying it on too thick, but it's worth noting that the portents of Alexander's death were recorded by historians, and the ancients paid close attention to that sort of thing. The final quarter of the book is grim, with only a few moments of light, and the most poignant moment is when Bagoas, having kept watch over Alexander even after his death, finally gives way to the Egyptian priests who come to embalm the Macedonian.It isn't all romance and grief. Bagoas is, after all, only sixteen when the affair starts; he's prey to insecurity about his place in Alexander's heart, and his two antagonists are Hephaistion, Alexander's lifelong love, and Roxane, the legendary beauty who becomes Alexander's wife. With Hephaistion, Bagoas indulges in the sort of reverie that anyone who's ever had a romantic rival can identify with (stopping short of cutting him into little pieces and feeding him to the dogs). Roxane, on the other hand, earns Bagoas' hatred for good reason, and she is presented as everything Hephaistion isn't: clinging, vindictive, and devouring. Bagoas wryly notes that Alexander has, like most men, married a woman like his mother, and it's asides like this from him that make the story such an indulgent treat to read.Like other reviewers, I will say that if you despise homosexuality and homosexuals, don't pick up the book. But if you can put aside prejudices and read for the sheer pleasure of encountering excellence in writing and losing yourself in another place and time, \"The Persian Boy\" is still in print.\"}"}]}

Focusing on the hardships of the Joad family and their friends, Steinbeck gives us, in microcosm, a look at the entire population of the dispossessed of the Great Depression.

Fortunately, for America, the poor did maintain these virtues, otherwise it would have vanished or rebelled, throwing the nation into anarchy.

You will not learn Giron Arnis Escrima from this book alone, but I've found dozens of little bits of information in here that supplement the training I receive in my FMA class.This book is most valuable to the student or interested observer who wants to find out more about how a Master's philosophy of life colors his martial arts practice. This is bare-bones information -- less about 'secrets' as things that the master tries to hide from the public and more about 'secrets' that are subtle elements of the art that one only gets from observing someone who has achieved Giron's level of quiet competence in any situation. It's also one of the only records we have of this grandmaster's method and emphasis in his practice studio that was done while Leo Giron was still alive and teaching. It captures something that would otherwise be lost as his teaching is passed on and evolves from teacher to student.Somera is a competent and functional writer and the book is laid out in a logical manner. The photos don't show all that is going on in the techniques, but they do capture the most critical elements and are enough for a student to piece the techniques together with just a bit of qualified training and a patient and willing training partner.If you are interested in an engagingly written history of FMA in general then you would probably do better with one of Mark Wiley's books likeFilipino Martial Culture (Martial Culture Series). If you are more interested in Leo Giron's life and how his combat experience in the Philipines during WWII helped to shape his art or details about the birth of American FMA in Stockton, CA during the '60s then you would be more interested in Somera's other bookGiron Escrima: Memories of a Bladed Warrior, which covers Giron's life story in more depth and also talks about the cultural environment that led people like Giron and Cabales and LaCoste to open their schools. But none of these books offer a no-nonsense record of Giron's legacy of instruction the way that this book does.\"}"}]}

The only thing this story lacks is character development, as there is none to speak of, save for John Good's brief and tragic romance with an African.For the PC crowd, this novel is pretty high on the Offend-O-Meter. The native Africans are constantly referred to as ignorant \"savages\" and they are held in low regard to the native European colonists. The hero of the story is an elephant ivory hunter who kills for money, as well as mere pleasure. Plus, the romance between John Good and a native African is considered impossible and a \"complication\". But, hey, this book was written in the 1880's and, with that perspective, these can all be dismissed as relics of an earlier time.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this book for a light and easy read. There are no complex subplot developments and no deep philosophical ideas to ponder, but it is an entertaining adventure story.\"}"}]}

This book has inspired me to continue reading the trilogy of the Lord of the rings. The size of the books look intimidating, but if they are as good as The Hobbit, then it should be worth it.The Hobbit was everything i looked for in a book. It was packed full of action, packed fool of fantasy, and packed full of dialogue that never bored you. Every chapter set the stage for the one that was to follow. It always left you reading and never being able to find a spot to stop because you want to see what occurs next in the plotline.Gandalf definitely stood out as a peculiar character to follow. In this story, it is very hard to tell what his real agenda is. It APPEARS that he wants Bilbo to go on his adventure for danger and excitement, but maybe what he really wants is what's best for him (Bilbo).Bilbo never intended on leaving The Shire to begin with, and ever since he took that first step out of the door, he continuously wishes he was back home sitting in front of a fire reading a nice book smoking some pipe weed. He faces some very hard trials on his journey to the Lonely Mountain. From almost being eaten by trolls, to being captured by the woodland elves. Still, Bilbo and his gang of friendly dwarves manage to continue onward.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who has a fetish for fantasy books and action books. Take it from me; this book never leaves you bored at any point at all. Once you start reading and getting into the events of the story, you will find it very hard to find a place to leave off for another day.\"}"}]}

And she believed it - until the night she stumbled across a secret that proved that everything she knew was a lie. Now Vega and her best friend Delph must find a way to make it across this terrifying land of bloodthirsty creatures and sinister magic. But the Quag is worse than Vega Jane's darkest imagining. It's a living, breathing prison designed to keep enemies out and the villagers of Wormwood in. The Quag will throw everything at Vega. It will try to break her. It will try to kill her.

The town of Bedford, Maine -- prime Stephen King country -- has two problems that are closely tied together in a dance of the dead. When the environmentally polluting paper mill is finally shut down in this one company town, the societal fabric that held the town together from good times to bad times falls apart as most people leave town as quickly as possible and those who remain hope that something good will happen to their bleak future. Most of the residents choose to blame the mysterious and silent Susan Marley as she walks around town in her shabby clothes and bare feet, regarding her as a witch who infects their dreams with nightmares of a burning mill, and a slut who takes anyone who can pay her rent or give her cigarettes. The people closest to her, such as her younger sister Liz and her former alcoholic school teacher/lover Paul, experiences the most pain and suffering as long kept secrets are being exposed in the wake of her supposedly accidental death when she rises from the grave to unleash the ghosts of the past upon those who remain in town. The narrative prose has a sharp, biting presence that's very refreshing as the conventional horror archetype of the bad place and the bad girl are combined to present a creepy story. The ending was fairly predictable as the both the bad place and bad girl must perish for good to triumph over evil, but I was surprised to see that the story's true resolution was the two sisters understanding each other after both had assumed something about their that was untrue in the hidden secret that tore their family apart\"}"}]}

Why do we \u201cdress up\u201d for church? Why does the pastor preach a sermon each week? Why do we have pews, steeples, and choirs? This ground-breaking book, now in affordable softcover, makes an unsettling proposal: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is rooted, not in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles. Coauthors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence and extensive footnotes that document the origins of modern Christian church practices. In the process, the authors uncover the problems that emerge when the church functions more like a business organization than the living organism it was created to be. As you reconsider Christ's revolutionary plan for his church\u2014to be the head of a fully functioning body in which all believers play an active role\u2014you'll be challenged to decide whether you can ever do church the same way again.\", \"authors\": \"['Frank Viola', 'George Barna']\", \"publisher\" : \"Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.\", \"text\" : \"I appreciate the many reviews that examine the book Pagan Christianity?.

When you look at the state of the modern-day western church, I believe they have painted an accurate picture of what is really going on with the church. As a friend of mine here in Mississippi says, \"Is you is, or is you ain't?\".I especially appreciate the background information provided in the footnotes. Interestingly, while I was waiting for the book to be delivered from Amazon, I was led to go to Frank Viola's website. After reading much of what he presents there regarding the book, I saw two things that jumped out at me: 1) the statistic that over 51% of the people who have publicly condemned the book HAVE NOT ACTUALLY READ IT! And, 2) I saw Frank's heart come through by the way he answered his critics. I truly believe this man to be a humble servant of God who is working to differentiate between things that are truly of God and those things man has invented and passed off as God.I am glad I went to Frank's website to get a better glimpse of the man who wrote the book. He even says that a sequel will be coming out sometime this summer to offer alternatives to what they present in Pagan Christianity?. I think the only challenge I had about the book was that after surgically cutting open what a lot of people have held dear in their lives (the authors expose so many sacred religious cows, it is a wonder the church is not Hindu!), there is very little \"post-op rehabilitation\". While I know that you first have to cut out the cancer (the intent of this book was to first expose the pagan traditions that have been passed off as \"of God\"), if I didn't know that a sequel was planned, I would have felt like I was left to bleed out on the operating table without anyone around to stop itMy prayer is that Frank and George will use the same due diligence they used to expose a flawed foundation in the Church to write a sequel that drips with hearts of love, grace, and restoration to show us \"the most excellent way\" to some alternatives to the current form of \"doing church\". Otherwise, many who have read Pagan Christianity? (Primarily the paid religious professionals we call pastors) will not recover from the initial surgery.\"}"}]}

Hardy's writing doesn't just move the plot from one point to the next, it undulates and flows from season to season with Tess as her life flows from one point to the next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, it does have a good amount of pagan imagery and associations. Tess is dancing on May day (the first of May) when Angel and she first cross paths, Angel often calls her by the names of pagan godesses when he is wooing her at the dairy and she agrees to work for Farmer Groby until \"Old Lady's Day.\" The imagery that Hardy interweaves in the novel is even more pagan. Tess is virginal and innocent and hopeful, like a nymph or thing of nature. And even when she's no longer a virgin (a rather important event in the novel) she's still innocent and hopeful. Truly, she does not lose her hope until the very end and then she is allowed to regain it, if only momentarily. The hardest thing about reading this novel is that it is tragic, for Tess anyway, the whole way through. But that's the way Hardy meant it. And in the end it breaks your heart. But not in a melodramatic way, drawn out, Hollywood ending/Braveheart kind of way. More like the slice of the guillotine: quick, clean, but certainly not painless.

As an author, Heller will not rest until you, as the reader, are his equal as a cynic. He pulls it off masterfully, too, his persuasion of patriots into perversion of their most beloved creeds, his destruction of the reader's regard for respected traditions and accepted notions about America. Through the words of the brash, self-centered Captain Yossarian as well as the from the perch of omniscient narrator, Heller tells it like it is (says he). The world is a petty place, and survival is job one. That Yossarian, as the antihero, would shamelessly sabotage the arrangement of a dangerous support mission rather than risk his neck to help out others reflects a Darwinian influence that resounds without compassion. &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on,&quot; rants Yossarian as he argues with the overly intellectual Clevinger. Yossarian displays no qualms as he announces, with conviction, &quot;It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot; What makes Heller's work in this novel so excellent is the fact although his ideas are morally bankrupt and bleak, he masks their horrid faces masterfully with his ingenious strokes of hilarity.

You have to have this book in your collection as the \"standard\" by which to judge everything else ever written about it. Smyth was the Astronomer-Royal for all Scotland, dealing with numbers and math on a daily basis, transferred his mind and focus to understand the purpose of its being which, some say, took either 20-years or 100-years to build.

The two main measures when built were the Egyptian Royal Cubit of 20.625\" and the Pyramid Cubit of 25.000\", the latter of which gives us a figure of 365.242\" Pyr. Cubits for the base. This measure just happens to be the exact measure of time, to three decimal places, in its base measure. In Greek feet measure, it is an even 720' Greek feet, another sign of source measure, that has been attributed to the Greeks by Europeans 200+ years ago, but which came to our textbooks in false assumptions. There are signs that the Pyramid was built 12,000 years ago, and not 4,600 as Egyptologists still claim.

It is, however, fun to read and bears witness to the polemics of an earlier era (one would wish!).I do not have the space here to give a complete analysis of Boettner's shortcomings, but will cite some representative examples. Moreover, I do not speak here as an apologist for the Roman Catholic church. I am, in fact, like Boettner, a Reformed Protestant, though also a philosophy professor at a Roman Catholic University. It does not seem to me, however, that the cause of Protestant Christianity is well-served by inaccurate portrayals of other traditions or criticisms that only attack straw men. I write this review, then, on behalf of truth.Boettner's first chapter combines various ends: defining Protestantism, attempting to associate Catholicism with communism, accusing Catholicism of developing various heresies and inventions, and painting a portrait of the supposedly sad state of Roman Catholic nations. Let's consider his discussion of the &quot;heresies&quot; and &quot;inventions&quot; which he implies are held to be part of the unchanging and infallible teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and thus are &quot;binding&quot; upon all Catholics (pages 7-10).In point of fact, very little of what he mentions would fall into that category. For instance, fasting on Fridays, the temporal power of popes, the withholding of the cup from the laity, and the use of Latin, have all changed since they were never a matter of Catholic &quot;doctrine&quot; per se. Moreover, Boettner distorts the implementation of many of these practices. For instance, the &quot;imposition&quot; of the Latin language by Gregory in AD 600 was done in order that the liturgy might be celebrated in the common language of the people (i.e., Latin), rather than in the Greek that was widely used up to that time. Likewise, while the discipline of celibacy was required for most priests since 1079, that is only true in the Latin rite of the Catholic Church. In the Eastern rite, married priests have always been permitted and are to this day. Nor was the Bible ever &quot;forbidden to laymen&quot; by a Council of Valencia in 1229. For one thing, there was no council in Valencia in 1229 since it was under Islamic control. A local council with local authority, however, was held in Toulouse that year and it did temporarily (and quite understandably) limit the use of the Bible by roving lay-preachers who were spreading the Albigensian heresy.As another example, we can consider Boettner's treatment of the mass in chapter eight. It is evident here that the book is quite dated, presupposing a eucharistic liturgy which hasn't been enacted (except rarely) in three decades (pages 169-171). Boettner's discussion of the Roman Catholic priesthood and the &quot;sacrifice of the mass&quot; gives little indication of any detailed knowledge about those doctrines, their histories, or their current status. For instance, he appears unware of centuries of debate among Roman Catholic theologians on whether the notion of the eucharistic &quot;sacrifice&quot; is to be taken in an &quot;oblationist&quot; or &quot;immolationist&quot; fashion. The &quot;oblationist&quot; view focuses more upon Christ's present priestly intercesssion before the Father. The &quot;immolationist&quot; view, on the other hand, focuses more upon Christ's presence upon the altar in a figure of death. While the latter view is certainly problematic for Protestants and the view against which we have traditionally objected, it is the former view (&quot;oblationism&quot;) which has gained ascendency in the 20th century and thus must be addressed today. And I know of no Roman Catholic theologian who would agree with Boettner's description that the mass is a &quot;re-crucifixion&quot; of Jesus and few who would even accept the language of the mass as a &quot;continuation&quot; of the sacrifice of Calvary (page 174). Unfortunately, Boettner's almost complete lack of bibliographical references to Catholic authorities makes it difficult to know from where he drew his information.I cite these few examples as representative of the ways in which Boettner's book falls short. As Protestants we certainly must maintain a faithful witness to Reformation truth, but that task is not advanced by careless scholarship, distortion of one's opponents, and slipshod argumentation. While there are some things of value in Boettner's classic book, I would advise those who are interested in understanding the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church to refer to offical documents (the catechism, councils, encyclicals) and their prominent interpreters among recent theologians.\"}"}]}

Doc Lusane must overcome his need to die; James Jaggers his need to kill; Pee Wee Anson to hate. The home front explodes in a frenzy of hate and violence. The boys discover love beyond the peculiar cadence of language and dialect. They discover life beyond race or color. They discover themselves. America was at war thirty-five years ago and we are at war today. A Buffalo's Revenge is a snapshot of America, then and now.\", \"authors\": \"['Bob Lupo']\", \"publisher\" : \"iUniverse\", \"text\" : \"This fast-paced, turbulent novel focuses on passionate men and women, both American and Vietnamese, caught in a seemingly surrealistic web spun by the war in Vietnam during its intensity of the late sixties. From the author's own firsthand experiences, Lupo skillfully captures in the characters and plot that unparalleled ferocity of close combat---the dread, fear, and doubt---the despair and depravity---that creates a special camaraderie making the horror almost bearable for mortals thrown like coal into the very bowels of a burning hell on earth.Ominous events unfold in War Zone C (Tay Ninh Province) just miles northeast of Saigon near the Vietnamese-Cambodian border. Three young 25th Infantry Division soldiers befriend some local brothel girls in Tay Ninh City; the hometown of the Buddhist 'Cao Dai' militant sect and prime strategic target for local 'Charlies' and their NVA comrades, infiltrating like ants to honey through the infamous 'Dog's Head' border crossing tributary of the Ho Chi Minh trail. The GI's are told by the commie-hating girls of a plan to attack the 'Holy See' Cao Dai temple in Tay Ninh when South Vietnamese President Thieu is scheduled to give a political speech. This bit of round-the-bout intelligence sets the stage for the decimation of the crack NVA 350th Regiment in a monumental battle with few US loses.Great stuff for starters, as Lupo leapfrogs events into an intriguing, page-turning story. The three GI's: Doc Luane, James Jaggers, and Pee Wee Anson, are promoted for outstanding 'undercover' work (no pun intended), and, as things often work in the 'Green-machine,' their boss and guardian-angel, Colonel Anson, is promoted to general and assigned to Saigon. Under the circumstances, this couldn't have happened at a more convenient time it seems with Luane, Jaggers, and Pee Wee fighting for their lives against the VC while managing to get married to their Vietnamese heartthrobs. The good general has them transferred to the relative safety of Saigon, just before Tet of 68'. We all know what erupted then.During all this melee, the girls become pregnant, and Lupo explores the unique personalities of Luane, Jaggers, and Pee Wee Anson now rubbed raw with primeval instincts bared. This is staged against a testy background of racial tensions and negative feelings surfacing against the war, coupled with the bitter catalysts of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy's assassinations back in 'The World'. Doc Luane with his death-wish, Jaggers killer-instinct, and Pee Wee's hatred must somehow be resolved for good to prevail over evil. They bond together in a common goal of somehow getting their expectant brides out of harms way by whatever means possible---even if it means working in the rather shady backdrop of CIA vagabond, Bill Jenkins. Without giving the poignant ending away, I just might say that the author makes the adamant point of America being at war thirty-five years ago while still rattling its sabers in 2003 against an evasive enemy in which there can never be a clear-cut victory---a 'Buffalo's Revenge,' so to speak.From both a literary and editorial perspective, the book is well organized in placement and sequence of characters and events. Diction, idiomatic construction, and maintaining a proper tone with difficult subject matter deserves special mention. The dialogue is excellent! Mr. Lupo has a talented ability to reproduce everyday speech---both American and Vietnamese---especially the half-humorous and half-hostile exchanges of men who live and work together in constant fear. Conversion of the text to that of a screenplay would give full justice to the author's literary finesse of brilliantly creating a catharsis out of the dismal abyss created by all wars. A 'dang' good Vietnam war era read---highly recommended!\"}"}]}

It was A. D. Howden Smith's inspiration to have it all come from the taking of a single treasure galleon, carrying the yearly mining production back to Spain, and that the portion hidden on Treasure Island was considerably less than half the total.Young Robert Ormerod's life just got a lot more complicated. Pirates are attacking just off New York harbor, he's just met a fascinating Irish lassie, Moira O'Donnell, and the great uncle he never knew about, Andrew Murray, a notorious Jacobite and pirate in partnership with Flint, has made him an offer he can't refuse: assist him in his latest scheme willingly or over his father's dead body. Accompanied by his father's friend, Peter Corlaer, a giant of a Dutchman who insists on being taken prisoner as well, an unwilling Robert plays his part in Murray's grand scheme: to take the Porto Bello treasure galleon and use most of the swag to finance another Jacobite conspiracy.As in Treasure Island the key relationship is between a naive young boy and a Machiavellian old man whose true intentions are difficult to read. Though Murray forcibly uses his grand nephew, he is also trying in his own way to provide him with a glorious future, whether Robert wants it or not. Also present are the younger versions of the RLS characters we know so well: Long John Silver, a Machiavellian not quite the equal of Murray who practices his famous charms on Robert, Billy Bones, Blind Pew, Black Dog, Ben Gunn, etc. In addition we get Smith's vision of Captain Flint (a roaring monster) and even Darby McGraw of \"Fetch aft the rum!\" fame.As you might have guessed, Murray's scheme doesn't go quite as he expected. Soon Robert, Peter, and Moira are attempting to stay alive amidst a maelstrom of conflicting conspiracies, and although events are considerably constrained by the plot of Treasure Island, there's still room for plenty of twists and surprises. In fact the ending fairly demands another sequel, a sequel that Roger L. Johnson delivered 77 years later inDead Man's Chest : The Sequel to Treasure Island.\"}"}]}

Even though only \"elementary\" calculus and abstract algebra are used, a certain mathematical maturity is required. I feel the book is strongest in the area of elementary --not necessarily easy though -- analytic number theory (Hardy was a world class expert in analytic number theory). An elementary, but difficult proof of the Prime number Theorem using Selberg's Theorem is thoroughly covered in chapter 22.While modern results in the area of algorithmic number theory are not presented nor is a systematic presentation of number theory given (it is not a textbook), it contains a flavor, inspiration and feel that is completely unique. It covers more disparate topics in number theory than any other n.t. book I know of. The fundamental results in classical, algebraic, additive, geometric, and analytic number theory are all covered. A beautifully written book.Other recommended books on number theory in increasing order of difficulty:1) Elementary Number Theory, By David Burton, Third Edition. Covers classical number theory. Suitable for an upper level undergraduate course. Primarily intended as a textbook for a one semester number theory course. No abstract algebra required for this book. Not a gem of a book like Davenport's The Higher Arithmetic, but a great book to seriously start learning number theory.2) The Queen of Mathematics, by Jay Goldman. A historically motivated guide to number theory. A very clearly written book that covers number theory at a graduate or advanced undergraduate level. Covers much of the material in Gauss's Disquisitiones, but without all the detail. The book covers elementary number theory, binary quadratic forms, cyclotomy, Gaussian integers, quadratic fields, ideals, algebraic curves, rational points on elliptic curves, geometry of numbers, and introduces p-adic numbers. Only a slight bit of analytic number theory is covered. The best book in my opinion to start learning algebraic number theory. Wonderfully fills the otherwise troublesome gap between undergraduate and graduate level number theory.Full of historical information hard to find elsewhere, very well researched. To cover all the material in this book would likely take two semesters, though most of the important material could be covered in one semester. Requires a background in abstract algebra (undergraduate level), and a little advanced calculus. Some complex analysis for sections 19.7 and 19.8 would be helpful, but not at all a requirement. The author recommends Harold Davenport's The Higher Arithmetic, as a companion volume for the first 12 chapters; according to Goldman it is a gem of a book.3) Additive Number Theory, by Melvyn Nathanson. Graduate level text in additive number theory, covers the classical bases. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject in 40 years. Some highlights: 1) Chen's theorem that every sufficiently large even integer is the sum of a prime and a number that is either prime or the product of two primes. 2) Brun's sieve for upper bound on the number of twin primes. 3) Vinogradov's simplification of the Hardy, Littlewood, and Ramanujan's circle method.\"}"}]}

But most of all, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" is a wonderful story filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) that no one who has read it will ever forget. Unabridged Dover (1994) republication of the text of the first American edition, published by Charles L. Webster and Company, New York, 1885. New introductory Note.\"\", \"authors\": \"['Mark Twain']\", \"publisher\" : \"Courier Corporation\", \"text\" : \"Looking for a good book to read? Well, just pick this one up, because The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great book. This is a very interesting piece of literature and is not like anything else I have ever read. Listen and you'll see why. This book is written in first person, and the story is told from the view of Huck Finn, a twelve or thirteen year old child of St. Petersburg, Missouri. The English used by Mr. Twain does not seem very good. He meant to write in this way, though, to give it a little more southern flavor and sound like a young teenager. The language itself makes the story interesting, and somewhat of a challenge to try and figure out what the characters are saying. Some words used, even in the first couple of pages, are \"whippowill\", \"didn'\", \"gwyne\", and \"sumf'n\". As you can see, Twain is very good at speaking in old American and southern talk. Another aspect of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the satire Twain uses. This helps us learn about the people of the time, as well as add to the entertainment value of the book by showing things that we find ignorant, which can be funny. Twain also uses satire to show weaknesses in society and look to make a point. Twain criticizes how gullible people are, how you can't trust everyone, and how some things that could be easily done are overdone. The gullibility of people keeps coming up in the book. First, they don't see the capability of everyone, especially the young. This can be seen on page 33 where Huck portrays himself as dead after using an ax and a pig to put the cabin in ruins with blood and his hair. Another instance is in Chapter 21. Huck dresses up as a girl and goes into a cabin to get some things for Jim and him. He calls himself \"Sarah Williams\", and even when he slips and calls himself \"Mary\", the lady still has no clue. Finally, she figures it out, but it takes her a while. A third and the most noticeable instance of how people are gullible is on page 132. The duke and the king, two people that come along with Huck and Jim, hold a play of Shakespeare. \"To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin, That makes calamity of so long life....\" The audience was wowed by these words, and have no idea that they aren't really reading Shakespeare except a little here and there. This also shows that you can't trust everyone you come in contact with. The last aspect that makes this story interesting is all the motifs in it. A motif is an idea, phrase, object, or element that keeps appearing in a story. In Huck Finn, the motifs are money, superstition, trust, and freedom. Money keeps occurring in the story. There is a reward for Jim and Pap, Huck's dad, Huck and Tom Sawyer find $6,000, he goes and sees a couple of wealthy families, and the foursome, with the duke and the king, try to raise money. Superstition happens with Jim. Huck goes to Jim to hear about his dad, Huck and Tom play superstitious tricks on Jim, and there are a number of other occurrences. Huck wants to have freedom from everyone and the town and Jim wants to be free from slavery. Trust, as I already mentioned, is a big motif. Characters find that they can't trust each other. These motifs are interesting because we all want money and want to see how people earn it, superstition is interesting to see if it is right, and we would like to know what kind of people we can trust. Also, the motifs keep us interested in the story by seeing if we can understand what they are talking about and by them giving clues to help us read the book, while at the same time keeping it challenging. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a good, well thought out, and plot-filled book. It is as good as anything I've ever read and you will have fun reading it. If you don't read anything else, read this because it is worth it.\"}"}]}

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O\u2019Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut\u2019s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as \u201cthe kind of writer who made people\u2014young people especially\u2014want to write.\u201d George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be \u201cthe great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.\u201d Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era\u2019s uncertainties. \u201cPoignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.\u201d\u2014The Boston Globe\", \"authors\": \"['Kurt Vonnegut']\", \"publisher\" : \"Dial Press Trade Paperback\", \"text\" : \"This book is strange, very strange. Death permeates this book and, each time it is brought up the author pops his head above the waters and tells us, \"So it goes.\" There are an awful lot of times we see the phrase, \"So it goes.\" in this book.Is this an anti-war book, then? If there is a central episode in the book, and that's not exactly clear, it's the firebombing of Dresden on the 13th February, 1945 - an undefended civilian town. Although it's impossible to know how many people were killed, Kurt Vonnegut uses the high estimates in the book. Whatever the number it's clear that this was one of the most disturbing episodes in World War II and one that obviously effected Kurt immensely.The telling of this tale, then, could be considered anti-war. Indeed in chapter one, which is really an extended author's note, Kurt talks about this. He is cautioned against writing an anti-war book - it's like writing an anti-glacier book, he is told, because there is no way to prevent it. And I think that Kurt realizes this. And he tells us they'll always be death anyway. So it goes.\"The Children's Crusade\", the sub-title of the book, reveals the truth about the second world war - that it is fought by young, inexperienced unprepared men fighting for a country they don't really believe in. A character appears in the book, an American who has turned traitor and is working for the Nazis, who details how the American poor are so downtrodden that they have no sense of loyalty or proprietary - compared, we have to assume, with the salt-of-the-earth European poor. On this level, this book stands with \"Catch-22\" and \"The Naked and the Dead\" in giving a brutal, damning account of the ridiculousness of those who actually fought WW II. \"All the real soldiers are dead.\" So it goes.But this novel isn't a war story at all. It permeates it but the substance is quite different (by the way, the sample pages are from chapter one which, as I have said, is more of an author's note, so they don't really capture the heart of the book).The majority of the book is much stranger and is told in the third person (with wonderful interjections by the author as he is heard in the background on a troup train or in the prison camp!). We follow the life adventures of Billy Pilgrim (A Pilgrim's Progress of course), a sad delusioned man who believes he can journey back and forth in time.And that's the way the story is presented - snapshots of time. Click. We're seeing him thrown into the deep end of the pool by his father to see if he'll sink or swim. Click. He's in a prisoner of war camp watching Cinderella performed by British Officers. Click. He's been transported by the Tramalfadorians - an extra-planetary race who see in four dimensions and provide Billy with all of his extraordinary insights. Click. He's in a mental hospital shortly after the war.The mental health of Billy Pilgrim is something we have to contend with throughout the book. Strangely all of his insights provided by the Tramalfadorians have already been written by a fourth rate Sci-Fi author he is introduced to in a mental hospital. At one point he is put on display by the Tramalfadorians in a zoo and has to live on public display - eventually with an adult filmstar who has also been captured. Strangely the science fiction author has already written about such a zoo.So, is Billy Pilgrim just living these books in his deranged mind? Is everything happening as he is recovering from massive head injuries sustained in a plane crash? Is the author a fictional invention of his too, someone visible to him only? This is part of the brilliance of this book. Kurt Vonnegut skillfully weaves what appear to be (and I'm sure are) real-life experiences of his time in Germany during the war with a brilliant but fractured mind.The Tramalfadorians don't read books like we do. They have a set of experiences that are all read in parallel. The great authors are not those who can tell wonderful tales, not those who can define great characters but those who can make the overall feel of all of these simultaneous experiences be emotionally fulfilling. Of course what Kurt is doing with this book is precisely the same thing - we get this small snapshots that seem to come at us from all directions and leave us with an experience that is definitely more than the sum of it's parts.My review really cannot do justice to this book. It is an astonishing work and well worth reading.\"}"}]}

Their one-night stand turns into something more, and night after night, Charlie's voice seduces Allie over the airwaves. There's just one problem with Allie's plan: she hadn't intended to fall in love.\", \"authors\": \"['Jennifer Crusie']\", \"publisher\" : \"Harlequin Treasury-Harlequin Temptation 90s\", \"text\" : \"Despite the fact that she was dumped, radio producer Allie's doing pretty well for herself - until her ex gets her demoted from the radio station's prime-time spot. Stuck with temporary DJ Charlie on the 10 pm to 2 am radio slot, she's determined to make him a star (nevermind the fact that he doesn't want to be a star at all). And if she can use a fling with Charlie to help her get over her ex, so much the better.It's not the best premise, but it's fun and different. Allie lives in a small town, and works with a quirky bunch of people at the radio station - including her dweeb of an ex-boyfriend Mark, who's a total jerk and really fun to detest throughout the book. Charlie comes to town with a hidden agenda - he just wants to do his job and leave. But Charlie is a lot of fun - especially for Allie. And the more they try to stay away from each other the more they fall in love. The sexy bits are fun & enjoyable, and I giggled a couple of times throughout the book.I always really enjoy Jennifer Crusie's female characters - they're often described as warm & soft, rather than thin and beautiful - each Crusie heroine is beautiful in her own unique way. I also enjoy it when Crusie has two male characters fighting over the heroine - it makes her seem extra awesome, and it's fun to watch her shoot the jerk down.Charlie is one of the funnest Crusie male characters I've seen - he's kind, witty, and laid-back. I always enjoyed the dialogue that he was in, which is good since he's a radio DJ. He also drums up some interesting controversy for the town, and I personally think that stirring up a little storm about political dirty business is attractive.There's only really one thing the bugged me in this book, and that was Allie's annoying hissy fit that proclaimed all rap to be psychopathic and all about raping women. As someone who really likes rap and knows that most rap is NOT like that, that was really irksome and I kinda wanted to smack her for being so close-minded about an entire music genre - especially for someone who works for such an unusual radio station.Other than that small hiccup, this book was a really quick, fun, fluffy read - which I desperately needed.more reviews at.... www.sarahsaysread.com\"}"}]}

Like many of E. Nesbit\u2019s works, it has proven popular with children and adults to this day. It has been adapted into a TV series, a musical, a film, and even an anime series. In this story, five siblings encounter an ancient magical creature in a gravel pit. The Psammead, as it calls itself, grants each of them a wish per day, with the restriction that it ends at sunset. As expected, all of the children\u2019s wishes go comically wrong, and it\u2019s up to them to solve the problems they created. E. Nesbit\u2019s enduring popularity is due in large part to the way she addresses children. Like Lewis Carrol and Kenneth Grahame, she engages children seriously, tapping into their imagination without any condescension. C. S. Lewis admired her, and the grumpy (but kind) sand-sorcerer Psamathos in Roverandom, a story J. R. R. Tolkien wrote for his own children, bears a striking resemblance to the Psammead\u2014indeed, an early version of the story featured the creature itself! This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.\", \"authors\": \"['E. Nesbit']\", \"publisher\" : \"Standard Ebooks\", \"text\" : \"I doubt I would have liked \"Five Children and It\" even as a child: an ordinary child's troubles are so much more troublesome than the challenges these kids face, it's almost (but not quite) funny. Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane live in a countryside mansion replete with servants, they take trips to toy stores where they can buy whatever their hearts desire (the author informs us that this is the way children ought to be brought up), and inside a gravel-pit they have found a prehistoric sand-fairy that grants them wishes, one each day, but all their wishes have been turning out rotten so far. Well, boo hoo.It isn't the concept that bothers me; it is the execution. Baum's and Carroll's heroines face comparable situations, but neither authors' books evoked such negative reactions from me. The reasons why the children's wishes fail I found especially abominable: when peerless beauty is wished for, the maid won't let them in since they look like \"eyetalian monkeys\"; when wealth is asked for and antique guineas appear by the bushel, the kids are arrested for thieves; when stolen jewellery magically reappears, it is Beale, the gameskeeper, who is immediately and incontrovertibly the chief suspect; when the four wish (accidentally) for the baby to grow up, the Lamb (Or Devereuz, or Hilary, or St Maur, as he should be rightly called) becomes a snappish fop. Nesbit draws miscellaneous moralistic lessons from her tale (\"I cannot pretend that stealing is right\"), but what use are these lessons when you are arrested whether or not you tell the truth? I would much rather Nesbit turn a cynical eye on the people she is describing, instead of using her keen powers of observations to weave an antithetical yarn.At least her prose is reasonable enough. Nesbit's language is lucid, and while her sentence structure is rather sophisticated, it is not unduly so. Sadly, the same cannot be said of her characters. The four children who are the novel's protagonists are essentially the only developed characters, and while they are developed rather well, with plausibility and realism, they are bland. They are honest, noble, polite, friendly, sociable, and well-off; they treat the servants and people of lower station as functionaries, tools, ways of getting from A to B, and so does the author. Thus, there is little desire on the reader's part to come to know them better. They allow little conflict, little empathy. I'm probably the first to levy the charge that they have little wit and, if not for the fact that the wishes disappear at sundown, they would have great difficulty dealing with ther wishes.But more about those wishes: it is quite surprising how many of them are accidental. In fact, there is little premeditated wishing going on past chapter six: otherwise, Nesbit would have been hard-pressed to find a reason for the children to wish for marauding Indians. What lesson are we, as readers, to draw from this? \"Word your wishes carefully?\" I'm reminded of the movie \"Big,\" in where a twelve-year-old wishes to be grown-up to impress an older girl, and instead becomes Tom Hanks and scares the heck out of everybody. Just once I'd like a book where the characters get their hearts' true desires and have to come to terms with THAT.\"}"}]}

Paces']\", \"publisher\" : \"S. Chand Publishing\", \"text\" : \"Charles Dickens wrote The Pickwick Papers in his early 20s, but the writing is first rate and as witty as any seasoned author could have done in his place! Like many of Dickens's works, Pickwick was published in monthly installments, or \"numbers\" as they were called then. Although Dickens originally intended to end the story at the twentieth number, the popularity of the series (and the resultant income) convinced Dickens to double the length to forty numbers. The end result is a large offering that'll take you a while to get through (~750 pages in the excellent Penguin edition, which I read).Despite its length, Pickwick never tries your patience. It's delightfully humorous from beginning to end. Samuel Pickwick is the bumbling, middle-aged, wealthy namesake of this novel. He's the leader of a small group of single men that gets into all sorts of mischief, both physical and social. Booze is rampant. Apparently liquor back then was much more a part of daily life than today; everywhere these guys go they party and get drunk. They get into trouble with the law, women, unsavory characters, and more.Characterization is superb. This is one of the few novels I've read for which I can actually say that I got to know the characters. In most books I've read, the characters remain two-dimensional and the plot is what carries the story. In Pickwick, the *characters* are the essence of the story and the novel wouldn't be memorable at all if a lesser author were attempting to breathe life into these people.The Penguin edition includes a decent collection of endnotes to help explain unfamiliar portions of the text. Nevertheless, there were still quite a few words and concepts peculiar to early 19th century England that I didn't grasp. This edition also has maps of southern England and a key to the specific locations that the Pickwickians visit. In addition, two appendices reprint some of the announcements and prefaces that Dickens wrote in relation to the work.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoy classic literature! Dickens's later works overshadow this gem due to their maturity, but Pickwick beats them all in enthusiasm, humor, and wit.\"}"}]}

It's a shame I wasn't reading this at the time that I was in college, because I was searching along the same paths he was (although I wasn't involved with bikes at the time, more along the lines of dance parties and the occasional search/rescue mission).For those that are entrenched in the classical science vs art dichotomy, Pirsig will shake you up some. But at the same time, he does bring a big revelation to bear: there is Art within Science, and Science within Art. And when we realize that we can indulge in both, we might be able to get back some of that pride in craftmanship that is so lacking in today's world.\"}"}]}

In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.

As I read further into the series, I found myself grinding my teeth at my haste for buying the latter novels. A fanatical WoT friend got book 9 the day it came out and I had it a week later to read.

This is my first review. At no time have I been more outraged by an author and fanatical reviewers to start reviewing books, especially this trash.First the author. I do not wish to reiterate other great remarks. Most of them have used the best lines out there, quite funny. I enjoy reading them more than the actual book. I visit here about 1/week for my rip fix. I agree with what other 2 or less star rating reviews have said. I don't own the book, so bear with me. One thing I do remember, there was a minor lord who had about the same name as another character, about a 5 or 6 letter name. Basically, the 2 [v]owels and the other 3 or 4 [c]onsonants were rearranged between the two names. A name like [Cvcvc] or something alone those lines. The series has an overabundance of characters with similar names containing the same letters; combined with the various clothing descriptions the book becomes frustrating. A better glossary is necessary where a minor character introduced would deserve a mention. Some of the major names and phrases aren't listed!

I finally searched the internet using keywords \"wheel of time\", \"glossary\", and \"characters\" to find the answers on a reliable website.Second the fanatical reviewers. There are a rare few 5 star rating reviewers that have true reviews about this book and this whole book, and nothing but this book. My review is not about them. My remarks are about the remaining reviewers, who are about as outrageous as the book. It doesn't matter if you started reading with the first book in hardback or book 10 in paperback, we at one time are/were fans of Robert Jordan and his world. We are reviewing this book, book 10 of WoT, \"Crossroads of Twilight\". We are NOT reviewing the next potential book, we are NOT reviewing any prior book, and we are NOT reviewing the overall series.To give CoT 5 stars because book 11 or future books will surely rock is ridiculous. Are you psychic? I remember reading something along those lines in the book 9 reviews and book 10 stunk so your ESP is off. To give CoT 5 stars because the first books were great is not a review of CoT, but of the other book. Please leave that review with that book and not inaccurately raise the rating of CoT. To give CoT 5 stars because you love the series but this book wasn't that great is misleading. That is a contradiction...\"this book wasn't that good and was slow and repetitive, whatever, but the series is great so I'll give it 5 stars\"...if you give what you are calling a mediocre book 5 stars, how can you truly express a great book? Please be honest about what you are reviewing, CoT, NOT the series. From what I've seen, the lower rating reviews are pretty much honest about what they are reviewing, this book. And stating the series is in decline is reflecting this book since it was horrible.As I said above, I bought the first 8 in paperback. Friend and library supplied the last 2. I will continue to use the library. Fortuntely, a friend helps me get the book early with his connections at the library, and the waiting list was HUGE the last time. A sign that others are wising up.Thank you for your attention to my rambling.\"}"}]}

H. Whitney', 'Random House']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House Reference\", \"text\" : \"Before moving to Finland for graduate school, I purchased Terttu Leney's TEACH YOURSELF FINNISH. Leney's is the most widely available Finnish textbook in the English-speaking world, and it did equip me with enough basic Finnish to comfortably settle into life in Finland. However, the book is not perfect, and in spite of its strengths it pales in many respects to other, more obscure textbooks.Leney's book generally follows the contemporary Teach Yourself format: dialogues are followed by vocabulary (first phrase-for-phrase glosses, then individual new words), then come exercises, and finally at the end of each lesson is a dialogue spoken more quickly in more authentic language that the student is challenged to at least get the gist of. Each lesson is dedicated to a specific subject, such as shopping, going to the doctor, or (towards the end) talking about history and politics. There are Finnish-English and English-Finnish vocabularies and, something which all other TY volumes should emulate, some advice on where to go next (books, websites, radio, etc.).While things like asking directions is a typical topic in beginner's textbook, I rather disagree with Leney's giving it so much attention. The lost tourist asking directions in limited Finnish is likely just going to be answered in English, Finnish people being so at ease with talking to foreigns in it. Rather, the challenge for people new to Finland is feeling at ease with a group of native speakers, such as classmates or coworkers, and so starting off with asking directions isn't so efficient, nor is the early emphasis on talking to bank tellers.The CDs are absolutely essential. With a sound system so different from English, Finnish is not a language that can be learnt well just off the page. Even if you have a couple of Finnish friends, chances are they couldn't enunciate like the folks on the CDs. Teach Yourself CDs vary widely in quality, but these are very good, with a large cast of voice actors so you just used to different voices, and a good mix of clear and \"street\" enunciation.What's wrong with Leney's course? Well, as a one-volume course its exercises are woefully insufficient. Agglutinating languages need much more drill than, say, Spanish or Italian, but the exercises here are few and train the student more to utter stock phrases than to internalize the huge amount of endings that conversational Finnish requires. It would have been better if Teach Yourself had commissioned a course from Leney in two volumes, a beginner's and an intermediate, which would have provided space for much more drill. Teach Yourself has done this for some languages, but regrettably not \"smaller\" ones.If you want to learn Finnish, by all means acquire TEACH YOURSELF FINNISH. However, at the same time you need to get a few other books. In my Finnish for foreigners courses at University of Helsinki, the assigned textbooks were Leena Silfverberg's SUOMEN KIELEN ALKEISOPPIKIRJA and SUOMEN KIELEN JATKO-OPPIKIRJA (both published by Finn Lectura). While it might be a bit of work ordering those, and much in them is designed for classroom use, they abound in just the type of rigorous exercises that Leney's course lacks. Leela White'sFrom Start to Finnish(Finn Lectura, 2003) is also a useful textbook, and is available though this very site.This is not a bad course. However, like breakfast cereal that advertisements claim to be part of a balanced breakfast showing it in photos alongside bread and fruit, Terttu Leney's TEACH YOURSELF FINNISH is but one element towards profiency in Finnish.\"}"}]}

A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the \u201cAustrian School,\u201d which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt\u2019s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong \u2014 and strongly reasoned \u2014 anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.\", \"authors\": \"['Henry Hazlitt']\", \"publisher\" : \"Currency\", \"text\" : \"\"Economics is a science of tracing consequences\", depicts Henry Hazlitt's idea on the economy. Hazlitt claims that today's economists forget the most frequent fallacy committed by professionals, the fallacy of short-term effects on specific groups rather than society as a whole. Hazlitt utilizes multiple examples of past economic policies that have failed, and what initially brought those policies to closure. After thoroughly reading Economics In One Lesson, my thoughts on the economy have transformed from little knowledge of the subject to a complete understanding of past economic failures.The premises on production, inflation, and wages carry true statements, but seem outdated. Statistics and numbers used for basic economic explanations are recorded prior to 1980. For economic interest the premises remain true, but need updating for today's economist.Hazlitt illustrates excellent reasoning to the fallacy of short-term effects on specified groups through many simple ideas. The first reason describes means of production and societies resistance to work for low wages. For companies to produce, workers are needed as producers. If company A's output increases, workers wages increase. If company A has an increase in production consequently company B suffers. Company B's output decreases, and the workers receive no wage increase. Society will only see the benefits of company A, not the monetary losses by Company B. Secondly, prices, profits, and costs to society. Hazlitt relates prices to the law of supply and demand. When consumers demand more of a product that is available from a certain business, people will buy more of the product. Both the price and profits will increase for the business. If the demand is met, the supply increases production meaning consumers increase their buying from that particular company. If consumers only buy from that particular company, other related businesses lose the profits for their product. Hazlitt's arguments remain deductively valid throughout the explanations of the prior fallacy.Economics commits multiple fallacies if not carefully followed through with each policy and system. Hazlitt outlines many fallacies with the main point representing the fallacy of short term effects on one particular group rather than the long term effects on all groups, or the fallacy of over looking secondary consequences. Hazlitt briefly describes other fallacies, such as, the broken window fallacy and overlooking the general consequences fallacy. Although Hazlitt depicts several fallacies, I failed to see where he committed fallacies of his own.Economics can be broken down into many parts and Hazlitt thoroughly describes each piece of those parts. Hazlitt's points are made exceptionally clear and to the point. Hazlitt's ideas are simple for the unclear mind but involve a considerable amount of thinking for today's economist. As stated before, economists often fail to realize secondary consequences to their actions.The economic fallacy claims are fairly consistent throughout the book. The central fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences constitutes a major portion of the book. Hazlitt uses several illustrations to back up his claims of the failure to see secondary consequences and the impact they had on economic policies. Almost every economic policy commits a fallacy, and Hazlitt easily describes the fallacies and failures to the readers.The arguments that Hazlitt conveys provide a complete understanding for economic fallacies and the impact they have on policies today. All evidence that Hazlitt uses on economic fallacies relates policy failures to overlooking secondary consequences. If today's economist only see the benefit of company A or product 1 rather than the suffering of company B or profit losses of product 2, economic policies will continue to fail. Hazlitt brings all aspects of the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences into account for the purposes of this book. Hazlitt's arguments seem fair and support all views of economic progressions and failures in the mid 1900's. The presentation of both sides creates equal representation for all readers. The opposing views carry strong arguments, but do not change the weight of the writer's outlook. Hazlitt's opinion illustrates the truth of economics, and the impact of policy failures on society.The key points of Hazlitt's book touch on several different economic stabilizers. Hazlitt begins with a strong introduction about the fallacy of overlooking general and secondary consequences. It is made clear that many professionals commit this fallacy over and over again. If economists and other professionals thoroughly verify the benefits and losses by the whole group rather than the benefits or impacts on one group, policies enacted will continue to work and increase profits, production, and costs in the economy today. Other fallacies are used to demonstrate the power of overlooking secondary consequences. The broken window fallacy, illustrates the benefits and losses within three parties. If a window is broken in Company A, but the owner wanted a product from Company B, the owner's situation becomes complicated. Now A has to buy a window from Company C instead of the needed product from B. Company A loses money to C, which should have supported B. Company C benefits, but Company B suffers. Hazlitt uses great ideas to support all of his arguments, and can be easily understood by all readers.\"}"}]}

Are Swedes truly shy, unemotional, conflict-avoiding, melancholy, and dour? Swedish Mentality, the English translation of the hugely successful book published in Sweden in 1989, considers the reality behind the myth. The author, \u00c5ke Daun, is a respected ethnologist who is sometimes referred to as the \"guru\" of Swedish character. In recent years, it has become popular to discuss Swedishness and Swedish identity. The advent of the European Union and the increasing presence of immigrant refugees in Sweden have fueled public debate on the distinctiveness of Swedish culture. Daun, however, goes beyond stereotype, drawing upon statistics gathered over more than a decade of research. The result is an entertaining and engagingly written book. Throughout, Daun quotes from interviews with native Swedes and immigrants as well as from travel accounts, folklore, and proverbs. We learn why some Swedes might prefer to walk up a flight of stairs rather than share an elevator with a neighbor and why some gain satisfaction from walking alone in the woods or going fishing. Daun describes a range of factors influencing Swedish character, including population composition, rural background, and even climate. He recognizes behavioral variations related to gender, age, class, and region, and he considers subtleties of individual character as well. Swedish Mentality should interest a wide array of readers, whether of Swedish descent or not.\", \"authors\": \"['\u00c5ke Daun']\", \"publisher\" : \"Penn State Press\", \"text\" : \"This was a very interesting book that enjoyed reading a lot. However, I do not entirely agree with previous reviewers who summarized the content of the book as saying that Sweden is dull and that Swedes has distaste for novelty. However, I still found all the other reviews helpful. Maybe I am biased because I am Swedish myself, but his book is a little bit more nuanced than that. The book was not anti-Swedish and not self-congratulatory.In general I would be suspicious of any book that tries to claim or identify national or ethnic characteristics. Such books are often either self congratulatory or hateful, especially those which claim not to be. Secondly it is a very hard subject to study objectively. If you do it by surveys the answers will be affected by local beliefs and prejudices, and local interpretation of words will distort the results. However, ke Daun still succeeds in doing what seems to be an objective assessment of Swedish Mentality. I am impressed by his efforts and he convinced me.I can add that even though I am deeply affected by my Swedish Mentality I have partially escaped it and become a lot more tolerant of those who do not share it. That is a result of me living abroad for so many years. However, we are all \"affected\" and perhaps \"damaged\" by our culture and our childhood environment. That is true not just for Swedes!If I were to summarize this book in just a few words I would say that Swedes are on average more pragmatic, quiet, non-aggressive, conflict-avoiding, rational, honest, diligent, punctual, orderly, and yes envious too. It should be noted that, this are the kind of personality traits that make the Swedish welfare system possible. Swedes are quite different from Americans and Southern European in behavior and thinking patterns which make culture clashes possible in those cases. Swedes are also surprisingly similar to the Japanese. Swedes prefer engineering and mechanical creativity over artistic creativity (again on average) which has resulted in some impressive accomplishments in technology and industry but not as many great accomplishments in art. I can add that Susan Sontag apparently had a very negative impression of Sweden, but I know some Americans who have a positive impression of Sweden.One aspect of Swedish thinking that ke Daun discusses which I have seen myself can cause some significant clashes between Americans and Swedes is the Swedish dislike for pride or \"bragging\". In America you are supposed to sell yourself, and talk \"you're self up\", and \"show yourself\", something that is a great \"sin\" in Sweden. By the way, I no longer think this way. Instead I easily adapt to the expectations of both countries (I am writing in America). In the beginning I had a hard time with the way Americans used the word \"aggressive\". One lady told me while watching my son play soccer, \"your son is so aggressive\", and when she saw that I was insulted she added \"which is great\". \"Aggressive\" in Sweden is always \"bad\" but here it can be something positive.Another Swedish peculiarity that causes some funny situations when Swedes come to America is the Swedish propensity for \"thanking\", especially for something in the past that they already said thanks for. Add imperfect English to the brew and you will understand why so many Swedes keep telling people they meet \"Thank you for the last time\". This always confuses Americans until the Swede has figured this out.ke Daun believes that the Swedish Mentality is partially a result of \"Protestant ethics\" which tend to expound \"impersonal virtues\" like honesty and diligence at the expense of \"interpersonal virtues\" such as warmth and forbearance. He also believes the Homogeneity of the country has a lot to do with it. However, he also attributes Swedish mentality to the short growing seasons, the land reforms, and the hard work and diligence required in Swedish peasant society. On page 202 he states \"Playfulness, tenderness, and anger over not getting what one wants, which today are recognized as basic elements of children's psychology, were given much less attention in peasant society\".Finally, in brief, this was a very diligent and surprisingly objective analysis of Swedish Mentality. However, since he did not take enough care to avoid giving those \"skimming the book\" a negative impression of Sweden, in combination with the fact that it is a little outdated (Sweden has changed a lot), and the fact that I see these sort of books potentially dangerous, I will knock a star.\"}"}]}

TolkienThe Hobbit is a very good and quite easy read. It is not very difficult to read because of the vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. Although in some areas it is a little difficult because the names of the dwarfs get confusing. The characters are explained very well and by the end of the book it really seems like you have met the characters. All except for Gandalf. Gandalf is a little less explained than the other characters, all of the other characters have a little backstory on how they came to be in the story. Although the author gives a brief physical description of Gandalf, Gandalf's personality or non-physical characteristics are unknown. I really like J.R.R. Tolkien's writing style because in one paragraph he is telling the story of what is happening and the next paragraph he may be talking directly to the reader which I thought was very interesting. My favorite character has to be Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is my favorite character because he is the character that the reader gets to know the most. Another reason why Bilbo is my favorite character is because he is an unsuspecting, \"normal\" hobbit when Gandalf came along and changed his life. I think what the author was trying to say through this book, was that life can change very quickly so enjoy what you have. You never know when the next wizard will come along and tell you that you that you are going on a quest. One of my favorite moments of the book was the Golem chapter, or chapter five. This is one of my favorite moments in the book because it really sets the entire story up and for the Lord of the Rings books. This is the scene when Bilbo picks up the ring that can make him invisible. I also really like the author's word choice and how he forms sentences that flow and transition into one another. I also think that the names of the places and people are very interesting. I thought that it was very inspiring that he made up his own language for the ruins. One thing that I didn't like about this book was that the names got very confusing and I kept having to flip back to figure out who was talking, what race the thing that was talking was, and what the relationship between the speaker and Bilbo. Another thing I didn't like about this book was how some of the characters were not explained as thoroughly as the others. \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\" This quote sticks out in my mind because it is a key describer, hook, and introducing sentence to the entire story. J.R.R. Tolkien was a English writer, university professor, poet, and philologist. Overall, The Hobbit is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone that has an interest in fantasy.\"}"}]}

Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be \"bewitched body and soul\" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated.\"}"}]}

Blackburn traces the history of fighter planes from the start of World War II at Pearl Harbor through the transition to jets in the 1950s. The author reveals the views on supersonic flight before and after 1947 by pilots, scientists, engineers, business interests, the government, and the media.\", \"authors\": \"['Al Blackburn']\", \"publisher\" : \"Rowman & Littlefield\", \"text\" : \"What a find -- a terrific read, an interesting poke at one of our most cherished icons, and a wonderful reminiscence about the \"golden age of test flight.\" Mr. Blackburn presents two main ideas in this book -- first, the legendary Chuck Yeager may not have been the first person to pass through the equally legendary sound barrier, and second, the need for public support for flight research dictated the credits for this accomplishment. The author test piloted for North American Aviation, which produced the XP-86 Sabrejet (discussed later), so he has singular credentials and credibility. His research seems reasonably well done, with personal, primary, and backup sources.The first person to become supersonic may well have been North American test pilot George Welch, in the superb new XP-86 fighter prototype. Welch may have jetted past Mach 1 several times before Gen. Yeager's immortalized flight (this takes little away from Yeager, who doubtlessly never felt Welch was first. The author also pays the obligatory adulations to Yeager's skills, although I doubt Mr. Yeager has bought Mr. Blackburn many drinks to celebrate this book). The author gives three reasons to suggest Welch was first. To begin with, the XP-86 aircraft was certainly capable of Mach 1+ (in a shallow dive), and Welch's skill and aggressiveness were up to it, too. Second, although the government gave Welch's team strict orders to let Yeager's Air Force team go first, Welch often cared neither a fiddle nor a fig about such orders. Finally, witnesses heard Welch's sonic booms several times before Yeager's.So why didn't anyone investigate the legitimacy of the claims for Welch and the XP-86 when the flights were performed? The author implies things worked out as they did for three reasons. First, breaking the sound barrier became a vast potential gold mine of publicity, and the \"powers that be\" wanted this publicity mined for purposes they would determine. Supporters of the brand new Air Force wanted the prestige. Furthermore, tremendous effort had gone into developing specialized research planes like the X-1, and few wanted to see the experimental aircraft program be swept into insignificance by a relatively non-exotic fighter -- the sonic boom was to announce a revolution, not a progression. Even North American later joined that revolution with its own magnificent X-15. Second, about the time the sound barrier was \"broken,\" aviation became very expensive, and progress depended upon public acceptance of the required effort. Therefore, aviation wanted a good publicist, and Yeager proved almost ideal. His confident charm seemed likely to pluck the funding right straight out of a politician's tight but awestruck fists. By contrast, George Welch was a fine young man and a superb pilot, but his speaking and social skills seemed, uh, marginal compared to Yeager's. Recruitment and public support for aviation probably benefitted from Yeager sitting atop the supersonic food chain. Finally, neither Welch nor North American made a big deal of the purported accomplishment (especially since it was forbidden by the top brass), and Welch was tragically killed testing an aircraft not long after these flights. At any rate, he did not keep complete data records for these surreptitious flights, so his methods (having witnesses listen to his sonic booms) were anecdotal. In my opinion, Welch's accomplishment, no matter how possible, is speculative, and Yeager' X-1 still indisputably claims the first properly documented piloted supersonic flight.Not that it matters so much. The author agrees the first supersonic flight turned out to be little more than an inspirational but dangerous adventure, and even for aviation, the publicity-to-direct-benefit ratio was high. The first supersonic flight, like the first Everest climb, was immensely uplifting but hasn't put food on our tables any faster or better. Few people will experience supersonic flight or an Everest climb, but if the stories about the first ones don't cheer your spirit, you should check to see if you can become excited about anything.Mr. Blackburn does far more than advance these ideas, however. With a test pilot's brassy style, he has crafted a genuinely interesting book about one of the most colorful chapters in aviation history, when dangerous and challenging aircraft filled the skies over America's test ranges and when computers weren't around to lower the danger but soften the adventure.The book has unfortunate ommissions. Although the author was a North American test pilot for may years and was granted access to first-source files, he documents these sources poorly in the Bibliography. Regrettably, he tells little about his company, which was an exceptionally productive jewel in aviation's crown. For example, would aviation have benefitted if publicity from the first supersonic flight enabled North American to survive? I hope this superb author will write more about this magnificent corporation, which eventually fell on hard times and became mergered out of existence. Sadly, Mr. Blackburn feels the irreplaceable files he used for this book face an uncerain near-term future and may soon just get tossed into the trash by their new corporate owners.A well-written, fascinating, controversial book, a chance to see how history and progress can be shaped by publicity and the need for the right hero, and a great gift idea for an aviation nut who has everything.\"}"}]}

Kenneth Tan', 'Osvaldo Gervasi']\", \"publisher\" : \"Springer Science & Business Media\", \"text\" : \"To my mind, there are three great Canadian literary figures of my generation (more or less) -- or, better, three giants of literature who happen to be Canadian. And that's Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood, and Alice Munro, all of whom brought Canadian literature onto the world stage. Munro is widely regarded, with complete justification, as possibly the best living creator of short stories in English. She's been doing this stuff since the 1950s and is still going strong. She's won all sorts of awards and she may yet snag a Nobel one of these days. A \"complete works of\" volume would be several times the size of this one, but the twenty-eight stories in these 500-plus pages are the very cream of a superior crop. Her stories tend to be about the ways people link to one another, spouses both past and present, parents with their children both young and grown, all sorts of people with those in their pasts and their futures. And the settings are most often the old towns of southern and western Ontario, old ports, mill towns filled with working families and boarded-up factories, and the hardscrabble farms a few miles away. These people in their old clothes, the children in their reworked hand-me-downs, often are poor though without acknowledging it, perhaps without even realizing it.Just as a sample: One of my own favorites in this volume is \"The Beggar Maid,\" about how people can be talked into bad decisions, by others or by themselves, including marriage. It's almost a very small but perfect novel, and, of course, Rose and Flo figure in some other stories. Another favorite, probably because I'm a working genealogist, is \"A Wilderness Station,\" quite a fascinating little multigenerational family epic. The subject of \"Lichen\" is serial relationships, none of which is ever quite good enough. \"The Progress of Love\" is another of Munro's classic explorations of the potential violence in love, carried out this time in masterful dialogue. \"Postcard\" is about the danger of making assumptions about what other people think and feel. \"Dance of the Happy Shades\" and \"Images\" each views a small corner of the adult world as seen by a child; like many of Munro's pieces, these aren't so much \"stories\" (with a beginning, middle, and end) as vignettes, portraits of people in a certain time and place and what they experience and how they feel about it. The most recent piece in the volume (though Munro has written many more since) is \"Vandals,\" which is also one of the longest. It's one of those stories that is almost impossible to describe. One can say it's about taxidermy and nature, or about unexpected death and the aftermath and what comes after that. It's about strange and completely unacceptable behavior. It's about people. It's a terrific story and it's also one of my favorites.\"}"}]}

Upon first glance this book is hard to read because we are not used to thinking in terms of complex propositions. And, like any textbook, the more that you put into it, the more you will get out. An understanding of loigc is necessary for even a superficial reading of the Bible. St. Paul in every sentence is using logic to its deadly effect. To read Romans and Galatians without reasoning properly is...For those of you who read the review of Mr. John M K and could not understand what you wrote, do not be alarmed. He deliberately spoke in incoherent sentences, which is what happens when you deny the validity of logic. The only time he did make sense was (for the sake of argument, I assume he did) when he was using logic to attack the use of logic. For example, thieves often reason this way, &quot;This is not my wallet but it is not the case that it is not my wallet.&quot; We usually do not take them seriously. I will let the reviewer decide the validity of that. With all due respect to Mr. M K, this is not the first time that he has committed logical fallacies in reviews (see my review of *Christianity and Liberalism*).The bright moments of this book is that the employment of logic opened up a new world for me. I fault Geisler with certain examples he used. Sometimes he did not go far enough. That aside, tis should give the student an understanding of the basic content and how to use it. After mastering this book I would recommend moving on to *Introduction to Logic&quot; 11 ed. by Copi and Cohen. For a quick refreshment of logic see chapter two of *Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview* by Moreland and Craig (I do not entirely endorse other parts of that book, but chapter two is pivotal).\"}"}]}

Additionally, the reader is given a synthesized introduction to the arguments of power, and how those arguments have shifted and developed over time.If a reader is looking to deeply and critically understand notions of power, this book is such a great starting place as Lukes has synthesized and produced a fine anthology of the notions of power, and with his introduction gives us (the reader) a road map to understand it! Now, if your interested in more of the \"newer\" concepts of power, such as ANT, Structuration Theory, Sociomateriality, and so on, then no this book isn't for you, dear reader, maybe.

When Ludwig van Beethoven lay dying in 1827, a young musician named Ferdinand Hiller came to pay his respects to the great composer, snipping a lock of Beethoven's hair as a keepsake--as was custom at the time--in the process. For a century, the lock of hair was a treasured Hiller family relic, until it somehow found its way to the town of Gilleleje, in Nazi-occupied Denmark. There, it was given to a local doctor, Kay Fremming, who was deeply involved in the effort to help save hundreds of hunted and frightened Jews. After Fremming's death, his daughter assumed ownership of the lock, and eventually consigned it for sale at Sotheby's, where two American Beethoven enthusiasts, Ira Brilliant and Che Guevara, purchased it in 1994. Subsequently, they and others instituted a series of complex forensic tests in the hope of finding the probable causes of the composer's chronically bad health, his deafness, and the final demise that Ferdinand Hiller had witnessed all those years ago. The results, revealed for the first time here, are the most compelling explanation yet offered for why one of the foremost musicians the world has ever known was forced to spend much of his life in silence. In Beethoven's Hair, Russell Martin has created a rich historical treasure hunt, a tale of false leads, amazing breakthroughs, and incredible revelations. This unique and fascinating book is a moving testament to the power of music, the lure of relics, the heroism of the Resistance movement, and the brilliance of molecular science.\", \"authors\": \"['Russell Martin']\", \"publisher\" : \"Crown\", \"text\" : \"'Beethoven's Hair' was truly a 'good read'. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed reading how the lock of hair found its way to the auction, and then into the hands of the two researchers. The structure of the book is rather humorous and relates to a musical form, tossing and turning between two different time periods: Beethoven's chronological life, and the modern (including W.W.II) time of research. Indeed, the book gives you plenty of spice and reveals much about Nazism and scientology, specific to the findings in the lock of hair, but be warned... if you expect a biography of Beethoven, the one you'll get is very weak, especially in terms of his compositions. I think, though, that this would suit any reader: teachers, music-listeners, doctors, miners, and literate persons alike that can take an interest in the history of such a great genious.\"}"}]}

The perusal and study of these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure to the reader, as they have given the compiler. Of special interest is the \u201cLegend of Hiawatha\u201d made famous fifty years earlier by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Some of the stories and lengends in this volume are: The Birth of the Arbutus A Legend Of The River Legends Of The Corn The First Winter The Great Mosquito The Story Of Oniata The Legends of Hiawatha, and many, many more. The American Indians, like so many cultures, built neither monuments nor wrote books. However, they did make picture writings, known in later years as \u201cwampum.\u201d Mostly, these were mere symbols, recording mainly feats of arms. However, the Iroquois used wampum as a record of a person\u2019s credentials or a certificate of authority. It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies, and it was used as a way to bind peace between tribes. Among the Iroquois, every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office. When they pass on or are removed from their station, the string will then pass on to the new leader. Runners carrying messages during colonial times would present the wampum showing that they had the authority to carry the message. Wampum is still used to this day by the Iroquois in the ceremony of raising up a new chief and in the Iroquois Thanksgiving ceremonies.

What this book and the early Anita books have in spades is sexual tension/doubt/discovery. What makes literary sex good is the lead up -- that's where Hamilton lost it, her characters became so blaise about sex that it didn't seem to matter to them anymore, so why should it matter to the reader?I had tried to read Anne Rice's S&M; Beauty trilogy .... past the first book, it was like being hit over the head with the same sex scenes, no character development, and little plot progression.

Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again.\"}"}]}

Yes, I picked up quite a bit from this book as well. The book talks at length about the Afterlife, Life Reviews, how each person chooses to be born, and the progression of life from the Big Bang. As far as engaging fiction, a few parts of the book are engaging. There are some longer sections involving a lot of explanation. Characters going over what they'd discovered about life and the purpose of life. Very helpful information. Rather long compared to the adventure parts.So the pro of this book is that there's a lot of insight, simply explained, at a level that just about anyone can grasp.The con is that the language lacks beauty and isn't very quotable. The action isn't what you'd call intense.I think the pro outweighs the con by quite a bit. There are some big ideas in here that are very accessible. And at 236 pages you can get this information pretty quickly.If the very long dialogue/explanation parts were put into a more elegant, well written non-adventure type book, that book would be a good deal longer.

Brokaw tells of a friend of his calling Nixon's administration \"the gestapo\" in a chapter that is supposed to tell the story of veteran Chesterfield Smith. Later, in a chapter on Bob Dole, he relates how once Dole referred to Nixon as \"evil.\" In the chapter on Mark Hatfield and others, the GOP is referenced with words like \"agenda,\" \"litmus test,\" and others. Bob Dole is the only person in the book that is spoken of as having multiple sides, and is the only person in the book where examples of his negative traits are given.

As things stand, I really don't have a way to evaluate that recommendation. What I can say is that this book is infuriating in a lot of ways. Mieville is undoubtably a talented writer; his sentences are crisp and engaging, his characters are well-drawn, and he is clearly out to create a fantasy book that's about more than swords and sorcery. His weaving of folklore and modern narrative into a gritty London setting is often very effective and recalls a very similar book by Neil Gaiman (Neverwhere). One can certainly do far worse than invite comparisons to Gaiman.That said, the plotting is a mess. There is too much going on by far, and about half of it feels unnecessary. There is a police procedural woven into the story that is entirely incidental; it seems to have been included to lend realistic weight (in the real world, although rarely in novels of this sort, the police would surely care that dozens of people turn up brutally murdered by a near-omnipotent sorceror) but not for any compelling aesthetic reason. Similarly, there are at least a few scenes (one involving a pudgy friend of the main character and a subway station, one involving a rat and a boat, as well as several others) that don't seem to have any function to the overall story. They're well-written and believeable, to be sure, but they aren't anything more than that.A smaller gripe I have is that I don't really know what to make of the royalty of the underground animal world. At the risk of minor spoilers, King Rat, Loplop the bird king, and Anansi the spider king left me baffled. These are anthropormorphized animals (think of the dog owners at the beginning of 101 Dalmations for a rough approximation), and Mieville makes no attempt to indicate that they are being written allegorically. They are, literally, a human-shaped rat, bird, and spider (respectively). Why would the royalty of these animal species be human? Are they shape-changers (which seems an unlikely explanation given that Mieville indicates that they can be replaced)? I have no idea, it's never explained, and there doesn't seem to be a reason for it except that Mieville needs a character who can straddle the human and animal worlds.So what we have is a novel that is quite good in a purely formal sense but that doesn't quite hold together substantively. Perhaps a different Mieville novel would make for a better - and less frustrating - place to start.\"}"}]}

Unlike some reviewers' posts here, I found the first 47 pages recounting the Hamilton-Burr duel fascinating. Ellis presents his subjects in a very human light. I, for one, finished the book with an even higher admiration for Washington; greater knowledge of Hamilton (whose genius and arrogant ambition reflected the best and worst of his times), greater appreciation for the significant contributions (and self absorbed vanity) of Adams, and finally, insight into the the duplicity and later redemption found in Jefferson. My only disappointment was that Franklin only received minor treatment in this book.The chapter on Washington's Farewell, and Ellis's treatise on the Slavery question are excellent.Full appreciation of the book does require some knowledge of the Revolution and early US History.

Lolita is just as much fun to \"watch\" or \"listen to\" as Humbert Humbert. (I never saw the films, but I could see the characters so vividly--such was the talent of Nabokov.)It has been a few years since i last read it, yet i can still remember laughing at Lolita's sarcastic reactions to H's pathetic clinging. I appreciated the voice she was given. She seemed believable, given she was written from an obsessive/Humbert's viewpoint, mind you. (...and i am pretty sensitive about the representation of females in literature)The book also sustains a poetic level. It is not a soft-focus sort of viewpoint, nor a highly-charged shocker. It's closer to the detailed prose of Virginia Woolf (e.g. the description of the hotel bed riddled with junk-food crumbs or Lolita fiddling with her shoe while being grilled by H.)The final level is that although it is a great 'story', it operates metaphorically. Why do you think Nabokov made Lolita so young? Because as a metaphor, she represented the allure of a comparably immature America to Europe at that time. America was in the throes of teen-aged rebellion, remember? And adults were also wallowing in the excess of the times. Humbert was both disgusted and seduced by what America offered him. Read Lolita (and all lit) with the context of history in mind, and you should be able to appreciate it more fully.Nabokov's poetic command of the English language should be experienced by all; Lolita is probably his best and surpasses most contemporary fiction.\"}"}]}

How could I have missed knowing them earlier? I read this story, with its \"country speech\" and \"country ways\" and wanted to take them all in. I wanted to comfort them all. I didn't know what I would find at the Joads when we first meet Tom going home. Who is this Tom Joad Jr. and why was he in jail? He must have had a HORRIBLE life to end up there, he must have. Then you meet the 'fambly.' You live with the 'fambly.' You see proud Pa try so hard to be the head of the home during the Dust Bowl migration. This family, who for generations upon generations, upon generations lived off their land. The land wasn't a piece of property, it was family. It fed them, it housed them. They raised a crop to sell, so they can pay off the loans they took when times were tough before. When the rains stopped coming, and the payments to the bank stopped being made, the 'banks' came and told all these people to leave. Imagine someone coming to tell you that the land you have lived on all your life, the land of your fathers and grandfathers belonged to the banks and you had to leave right now. Imagine the dread. All your life spent in the same place, with the same neighbors, the same strong values; \"Yes Sir! Yes Ma'am!\" No talking back, everyone knew their place. And then the dust came, and took away everything you knew.The Joads sell everything they own, load up a beat-up truck with the necessities (food, water, mattresses, clothes, pots, pans) and head towards the promised land of California. Along with 500,000 other displaced people. All looking for land to work; it's all they know. You get land, you work it, it's yours. They had no idea what life outside of Oklahoma was really going to be like.There's Ma, trying so hard to keep the family strong. She's the backbone.

I wanted to simultaneously smack the heck out of Rose of Sharon (Rosasharn) and comfort her in the end; tell her she really did do good in God's eyes at that very last paragraph. I saw Ruthie grow in those 7 or 8 months into someone I did not like. She was mean, she was vindictive, she was 7. I saw humanity at its worse. Things like this really did happen in the early 1930's, after the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. These \"Okies\" were treated with contempt. They were kicked off their lands, treated like animals, paid meager wages or in some cases, they were paid with a loaf of bread for 16 hours of work, and it's disgusting. How would you fare? What would you be willing to do to feed your starving family?It's a terrific book. I wish I knew how Noah fared. I wish I knew what happened to that spineless Connie. Is Tom ok? Did he take up the cause that Casey so tragically and instantaneously had taken from him? I imagine so. I imagine Tom forcing these cities who spurned them, who burned them out, who arrested them, to have to accept them; 500,000 strong. If not directly, then inspiring others to go on and on. The packing plants who throw away food, while these people sit outside the gates dying. The orange growers who sprayed kerosene on the overstock of oranges rather than give them away for free. The food thrown in rivers, with armed guards making sure no one took the food. Pigs slaughtered because they could not sell them, and hungry people staring, not understanding that there's a profit to be made.\"And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listening to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is a failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\"\"}"}]}

In many ways it's a very sentimental novel about Paris, the 1920's, drink, sex, and courage. While the novel begins in Paris, the reader is taken south to the Pyranees that border France and Spain, and then further south still to Pamplona for the running of the bulls. The book's hero Jake cannot consumate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley because of an unfortunate injury he acquired in the war in Italy, rendering him impotent. Brett is pigheaded, stunning, an attention seeker, and a flirt... this combination drives Jake crazy as she returns his love, but goes out with other men to get the one thing she can't get from him. This tragic scenario is masterfully painted for us by Hemingway from the very beginning of the book. So, the one thing that Jake wants to give to Brett he can't, and this makes him feel inadequate, and creates an ambivalence in her attitudes and behaviour toward him. Jake is the man she loves, he's right for her in every way, yet because of his injury she is driven away from him, and goes out with much lesser suitable men, one in particular is an out and out fool and a nothing compared with Jake. Hemingway makes the reader feel Jake's wistfullness and sentimentally about what could be between Jake and Brett, we also drink up the mood of Paris and Pamplona during the Fiesta... it's hard not to come away from the book with a crush on Lady Brett, a wish that you'd experienced Paris in the 1920's as Hemingway did, and perhaps more than anything else, dying for a drink... in classic Hemingway style, the characters booze their way through the novel from page 2. ***** Highly recommended.\"}"}]}

It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.

She is cunning, and her attempts to escape cost her &quot;house&quot; much. Chiyo will never be able to pay her debts.But the inspiration of a gracious businessman and the intervention of a mentor-geisha (bent on revenge toward a competitor)change Chiyo's bad fortune. The beautiful geisha, Mameha, proposes a business offer to Mother, Chiyo's housemother--a bet that Chiyo, under Mameha's tutorage will pay her debts by age 20. The greedy Mother accepts the bet and Chiyo becomes a geisha apprentice.There is a love story here as Sayuri, nee Chiyo, strives to win the affections of the kind businessman, the Chairman. The trials of war and the rebuilding of Japan nearly ruin the geisha trade, but Sayuri makes a come back, along with her country.In the beginning I feared the cultural differences would cause me to lose interest. Quite the opposite! I was fascinated with the geisha culture. I'd assumed that geisha were high-class call girls. While they did strive to be &quot;kept women&quot;, geisha were so much more. They were trained entertainers, party hostesses, and escorts. They were welcomed in businesses for the clientele they'd attract.

Lucky for him, it was.Part one: Mr. Norrell read so dreadfully slow and boring I almost didn't make it through. It reads more like the introduction to a dissertation than a fictional novel. I found the footnotes particularly distracting as they are not truly footnotes in that they refer to non-existent books and yet they must be read to make sense of the storyline.Clarke went overboard by writing 300 pages of dull material to emphasize an exceptionally dull character. Heavy editing would have benefitted this part of the novel.Part two: Jonathan Strange did read better than part one, but only because Clarke made the effort create a slightly more likeable, interesting character out of Strange. There are also more interesting locations and events (Strange actually does magic rather than read about it). It still suffers from overwriting and onerous footnotes.Part three: John Uskglass makes up for the tiresome reading in parts one and two. At last the novel comes back round to the two most interesting characters, Childermass and Vinculus (who could have made the previous 600 pages far more entertaining had they been more fully fleshed out). Proving that patience is truly a virtue, Clarke finally folds together the former hundreds of pages into a series of events that bring the story to a very satisfying ending.Clarke's debut is not by any means comparable to a Harry Potter book and I believe that many avid Rowling readers will be disappointed if they are expecting likeable characters, a quickly-paced storyline and loads of action and adventure. This novel is a serious investment in time and energy, but the conclusion is well worth it.\"}"}]}

Years pass, and Guinevere becomes a great beauty, riding free across Northern Wales on her beloved horse. She is entranced by the tales of the valorous Arthur, a courageous warrior who seems to Guinevere no mere man, but a legend. Then she finds herself betrothed to that same famous king, a hero who commands her willing devotion. Just as his knights and all his subjects, she falls under Arthur\u2019s spell. At the side of King Arthur, Guinevere reigns strong and true. Yet she soon learns how the dark prophecy will reveal itself. She is unable to conceive. Arthur\u2019s only true heir is Mordred, offspring of a cursed encounter with the witch Morgause. Now Guinevere must make a fateful choice: She decides to raise Mordred, teaching him to be a ruler and to honor Camelot. She will love him like a mother. Mordred will be her greatest joy\u2013and the key to her ultimate downfall. \u201cGuinevere comes alive\u2014a strong, resourceful, and compassionate woman, accessible to modern folk . . .

I think it was the first time I really understood who all of the characters were and how they are related to one another. For example, everyone has heard of Sir Galahad...but I never realized that he was Lancelot's son! And, really, who has ever really been able to distinguish between Morgan, Morgaine, and Morgause? In this book, though, McKenzie really brings all of these characters to life. She paints Guenevere as a strong, dedicated, honest woman who is dedicated to her husband and to her role as Queen. And she manages to make this all believable without really &quot;meddling&quot; with the traditional Arthurian legend (you know, the whole Lancelot deal). For those who love reading this genre, you will especially appreciate the way McKenzie builds into the story the &quot;factoids&quot; of day-to-day life, creating a three dimensional sense of the setting, the customs, the dress, the social mores and standards, etc., etc.This is a very long and detailed book, and will take some time to read, so be prepared. Personally, when it started feeling tedious (which it did, a couple of times) I set it aside for a few days and read something else. Because of the vivid depictions of the characters, I found that I could easily pick it up and dive right back in as if I'd just left it.Overall, a great job.

As Anne Perry writes in her Introduction, the novel \u201chas almost reached its first centenary, and it is as vivid and appealing as ever because the plotting is perfect. It is a classic example of how to construct, pace, and conclude a plot. . . . To rise on the crest of laughter without capsizing, to survive being written, rewritten, and reinterpreted by each generation, is the mark of a plot that is timeless and universal, even though it happens to be set in England and France of 1792.\u201d\", \"authors\": \"['Baroness Emmuska Orczy']\", \"publisher\" : \"Modern Library\", \"text\" : \"The Scarlet Pimpernel is a classic novel, though it is hard to categorize. It is part romance, part adventure, part spy thriller, and part superhero fiction. All of these elements went into the pot and the resulting stew is extremely entertaining.The book follows the adventures of Sir Percy Blakeney as he seeks to help French aristocrats escape the guillotine during the French Revolution. Since official English policy forbids this, Blakeney adopts a masked identity as the Scarlet Pimpernel to remain anonymous. The French, of course, detest this interference in their affairs and set out to trap and kill the Pimpernel at all costs. As part of his effort to deflect suspicion from himself, he plays the fool in every day life and he does it well. His own wife considers him a useless fop... and that's where the story really gets interesting.I won't give away more of the plot, but she ends up following him into danger in an attempt to save him. This allows the most suspenseful section of the book to be told from Mrs. Blakeney's perspective. Her terror for her husband's fate is pure and adds to the tension considerably. If we saw it through the Pimpernel's eyes, it would doubtless be far more composed and nowhere near as suspenseful.In closing, The Scarlet Pimpernel is well worth buying. It's laugh out loud funny, suspenseful, romantic, and generally quite a page-turner.\"}"}]}

Upon her father's ascension to the illustrious throne of England, Elizabeth Stuart was suddenly thrust from the poverty of unruly Scotland into the fairy-tale existence of a princess of great wealth and splendor. When she was married at sixteen to a German count far below her rank, it was with the understanding that her father would help her husband achieve the kingship of Bohemia. The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin \"the Winter Queen,\" as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost. But it was the youngest, Sophia, a heroine in the tradition of a Jane Austen novel, whose ready wit and good-natured common sense masked immense strength of character, who fulfilled the promise of her great-grandmother Mary and reshaped the British monarchy, a legacy that endures to this day. Brilliantly researched and captivatingly written, filled with danger, treachery, and adventure but also love, courage, and humor, Daughters of the Winter Queen follows the lives of five remarkable women who, by refusing to surrender to adversity, changed the course of history.\", \"authors\": \"['Nancy Goldstone']\", \"publisher\" : \"Little, Brown\", \"text\" : \"Being Russian and living in Moscow, I've read this novel a couple of years, before it was translated into English, and had since read several of the over novels in the series.So, I can't say anything about the quality of translation, but in Russian Akunin is a splendid reading experience!His grasp of the late 19 - early 20 century style is superb.

Outdoors, vistas to delight from every vantage point; inside, one ravishing interior after the other, all filled with furniture, art and objects of the finest quality and often great historical interest.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.

Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut\u2019s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as \u201cthe kind of writer who made people\u2014young people especially\u2014want to write.\u201d George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be \u201cthe great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.\u201d Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era\u2019s uncertainties. \u201cPoignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.\u201d\u2014The Boston Globe\", \"authors\": \"['Kurt Vonnegut']\", \"publisher\" : \"Dial Press Trade Paperback\", \"text\" : \"This has got to be one of the most original books ever written, and I would highly recommend it to anyone open minded enough to enjoy it.

There's also plenty of praise out there, so I'll shoot down some of the odvious misconceptions some of these other reviewers have about the book. This book is not ment to be a character study. It doesn't try to be, and it shouldn't be judged as one. The characters are pawns that Mister Vonnegut uses to tell us what we need to hear. This book is not character based. It is theme based wholly, and the charcters are not there to give us depth, but to act out what needs to be said by the author. This book is also not a typical novel, and people can't say they are annoyed about the random order of events, or the lack of a resolution. This book is made to fit the reader.

Quartet and The Underworld USA Trilogy, James Ellroy, presents another literary masterpiece, this time a true crime murder mystery about his own mother. In 1958 Jean Ellroy was murdered, her body dumped on a roadway in a seedy L.A. suburb. Her killer was never found, and the police dismissed her as a casualty of a cheap Saturday night. James Ellroy was ten when his mother died, and he spent the next thirty-six years running from her ghost and attempting to exorcize it through crime fiction. In 1994, Ellroy quit running. He went back to L.A., to find out the truth about his mother--and himself. In My Dark Places, our most uncompromising crime writer tells what happened when he teamed up with a brilliant homicide cop to investigate a murder that everyone else had forgotten--and reclaim the mother he had despised, desired, but never dared to love. What ensues is a epic of loss, fixation, and redemption, a memoir that is also a history of the American way of violence. \"Ellroy is more powerful than ever.\" --The Nation \"Astonishing . . . original, daring, brilliant.\" --Philadelphia Inquirer\", \"authors\": \"['James Ellroy']\", \"publisher\" : \"Vintage\", \"text\" : \"Both autobiography and biography, Ellroy narrates the account of his search for the truth behind his mother's murder in four parts. He begins with a cold journalistic account of the initial investigation that does not quite come off. In part two, he details a protracted adolescence that begins at age 9 when his mother is murdered and does not end until he is 30, in which his existence deteriorates into what call only be called depravity. The third part of the book delves into the life and career of real-life cop Bill Stoner and the beginning of the reinvestigation into the murder with Ellroy. The final part details his mother's life up until her murder, the outcome of the reinvestigation, the last murder case in the career of Stoner, and the trial of O.J. Simpson. This book is a must read for many reasons, but chiefly for its brutal honesty. Firstly, it is an unadulterated autobiographical account of the writer's complicated psychology and his descent into sexual perversion, drug addiction, alcoholism, and petty criminality. Rarely do we admit these to our close family and friends let alone an international audience and certainly not with the perceptiveness and brilliant narrative that Ellroy is capable of. Secondly, nobody knows the mind of cops like Ellroy. His are like no others described in fiction or fact, they are flawed geniuses that demand condemnation and sympathy simultaneously.\"}"}]}

It's obvious that one of the traits of sociopath is the compulsion to write letters. For this is the only way to manipulate when they are locked up. We all heard countless stories about women being lured by inmates with letters and phone calls so they would be willingly sending money and care packages. Ted Bundy, just like the I-5 killer Randy Woodfield years later, was a compulsive letter-writer and phone caller. He used the letters and phone calls to manipulate many women at the same time so he could get what he wanted, be it money (Ms Rule probably spent over $600 on him, a big sum at that time), emotional support, or material goods. Based on this and countless times Ms Rule's \"torn feelings\", I can safely assume that she's one of the duped. During her correspondence with Ted Bundy, she was a woman about to divorce, had 4 young kids to support, meaning she's emotional weak and dependent at the time. Any woman with healthy emotional state of mind would not tolerate to be manipulated like this.Looking at the Washington State victims' photo, they could be sisters! I feel so sorry for the families who lost their beautiful daughters. If they were to live, they would be almost 50 by now. They could be someone's mothers, wives, and co-workers......... I cringe every time I think about the could-have-beens and would-have-beens for those beautiful girls.Another thing that struck me during the reading was how easy it is to break into a place. Ted Bundy must have farmed his target area to see which building's occupied by young women, which one was easy to get into, which screen was loose, and which lock was malfunctioned. The fact that a lot of his victims were hit in their dorm/home while sleeping was chilling. I have to double, triple check all my windows, doors, and locks to make sure they are secure. I think all women who live alone or with other women should do the same night after night before they can safely close their eyes to sleep.While I was looking at the few pictures of Ted Bundy, it struck me how much he looked like Greg Kinnear. Mr. Kinnear has the same handsome but changeable face. Mr. Kinnear also has the ability to play a normal guy with internal turmoil/evil type (watch The Gift). If there's ever a movie made about Ted Bundy, I think he's the perfect choice.\"}"}]}

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today.

Written from the perspective of a free-lance writer, John, Cat's Cradle cleverly links a scientist's disfunctional family to a Caribbean island living under the illusions of a religion grounded on lies. Pursuing substance for his novel, The Day the World Ended, John contacts the family of Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. Consequently, John travels with Hoenikker's children to a Caribbean island, falls in love, assumes the presidency, and witnesses the destruction of the world. The text flowed very well; terse chapters maintained the reader's interest. Witty conclusions exemplified how humans are connected through intricate links. Vonnegut's varied settings, ranging from suburban New York to an impoverished Caribbean island, certainly maintain the reader's interest. Vonnegut also refrains from narrating the novel with an omniscient voice. On the contrary, John is ignorant about human relationships; this naivety evokes humor. Two themes the novel served to exemplify, illusion vs. reality and the destruction resulting from unrestricted science were prominent. To comprehend these themes, readers should be in the adolescent or adult age groups. The reader must also bear patience to see how obscure events string together at the novel's conclusion.

As a result, hundreds of Catholics suffered imprisonment and 24 were executed. Here is the background of that plot, its development, and its long-term repercussions. \"With the technical mastery of a seasoned professional...he retells in vivid detail an extraordinary tale of human credulity, knavery, and folly.\"--The Times.\", \"authors\": \"['John Philipps Kenyon']\", \"publisher\" : \"Phoenix\", \"text\" : \"In August 1678 Titus Oates, an unemployed clergyman of dubious habits, disclosed to a mentally unbalanced colleague, the Rev. Israel Tonge, the existence of a large scale Roman Catholic conspiracy to assassinate King Charles II and set up a puppet government that would return Protestant England to the days of Bloody Mary. Oates had learned of this plot, he claimed, after converting to Catholicism the year before and spending a few months at a French seminary (from which he had been expelled for moral and intellectual deficiencies). Leading members of England's underground Catholic priesthood had supposedly spoken freely in front of this unprepossessing novice, enabling him to construct a dense narrative of names, dates and \"facts\". Tonge, author of numerous paranoid anti-Catholic tracts, was delighted to have such a witness to Papist malignity and rapidly pushed Oates in front of the authorities, including the king himself. From this beginning followed, over the next year and a half, over 30 executions for participation in the imaginary plot. The pursuit of the \"plotters\" was not the only, perhaps not even the greatest, miscarriage of justice of the era, but it is surely the best remembered, and most of the victims have since been recognized by Rome as martyrs for the Faith. Six of them were canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970.John Kenyon's history, first published in 1972 (Phoenix Press reprints the slightly revised 1984 edition), is the classic account of the Plot, a story interesting both as a striking episode in English history and for the light it casts on similar conspiratorial accusations in later eras (even in our own). Professor Kenyon furnishes a firm, clear record of frequently baffling events, demanding of the reader only a modest acquaintance with Restoration history and politics. He also explains, as plausibly as one could hope, why belief in the Plot took root and flourished.Oates and the copycat informers who supplemented his fantasy with ever more lurid tales drew on a deep-seated fear of Catholics and Catholicism, heightened by the perception that Romanism was steadily gaining strength and enjoyed special favor at the royal court (where, indeed, the Queen and the King's brother, the Duke of York, were Catholics). A few Catholics confirmed the fear mongers by talking wildly about restoring the old religion (and a small number, like the famous Guy Fawkes, really did attempt murder and treason), but the typical recusant was a staunchly conservative landowner, attached to the existing order and wishing only to practice his religion without excessive harassment. One reason why the Plot did not claim a far greater number of victims was that Protestant gentry in the countryside refused to believe charges against their Catholic neighbors and protected them from the power of the judiciary.Anti-Catholicism was a constant in the English polity. Compounding it were more adventitious factors: the partisan hatreds left over from the Civil War (the judicial murder of Charles I was less than 30 years in the past), the paucity of sources of information about current events and, most important in this particular case, the Crown's lack of political confidence. Charles II and his advisers believed that their domestic enemies were powerful, malicious and intractable. They knew that the government was short of financial and military resources. Thus, even though no one at Whitehall truly believed Oates, the safe, expedient path was to allow \"justice\" to devour a few sacrifices, while waiting for a backlash against the hysteria. The waiting strategy in fact worked, and a powerful Tory reaction made Charles' last years politically comfortable, but the Plot martyrs gained no benefit thereby.Amidst these large explanations, Professor Kenyon does not lose sight of the particular and accidental. Oates was an exceptionally bold liar, who commanded belief by sheer effrontery. And his story gained sensational publicity at an early stage when the magistrate before whom he swore his first deposition turned up murdered a few days later. He then garnered undeserved credibility when a search of the papers of Edward Coleman, the Duke of York's sometime secretary, revealed correspondence with Louis XIV's confessor. To deflect the informers from York, Coleman was sent to trial and execution. His fate naturally made the uproar worse. Instead of escaping suspicion, the Duke finally had to be sent abroad to appease the mob.Other blameworthy behavior abounded. Especially appalling is the conduct of the judges at the accused conspirators' trials. One reads these accounts with a renewed appreciation of the virtues of our own judicial system. Heartening, on the other hand, is the courage of the victims, none of whom, despite intense pressure, recanted his faith or implicated others with a false confession.Professor Kenyon recounts these improbable events with care and even-handedness. Indeed, he almost turns the latter virtue into a vice by searching for some shred of justification for unjustifiable conduct. He suggests, for instance, that Edward Coleman was, by the standards of the time, actually guilty of treason, when all that the evidence shows is an effort to gull the French out of subsidies. Less forgivably, he insinuates that perhaps the homosexual Oates had obtained authentic tidbits of information about Catholic activities in the course of affairs with high-ranking Jesuits - a completely unnecessary hypothesis for which there is no support at all.Though its long-term impact was minor, the Popish Plot remains of interest to students of Seventeenth Century English politics, English Catholic history and conspiracy manias, for all of whom Professor Kenyon's volume is essential reading.(A curious footnote: Phoenix Press's cover reproduces period illustrations, which are interesting but have nothing to do with the subject of the book. Instead, they portray scenes from the later \"Rye House Plot\", which differs from the Popish Plot in two hardly trivial respects: First, it was a real conspiracy. Second, the conspirators consisted largely of Protestants who had believed and even sponsored Titus Oates.)\"}"}]}

That is, until the circus of Dr. Lao arrives and immensely and irrevocably changes the lives of everyone drawn to its tents.Expecting a sideshow spectacle, the citizens of Abalone instead confront and learn profound lessons from the mythical made real -- a chimera, a Medusa, a talking sphinx, a sea serpent, witches, the Hound of the Hedges, a werewolf, a mermaid, an ancient god, and the elusive, ever-changing Dr. Lao. The circus unfolds, spinning magical, dark strands that ensnare the town's populace: the sea serpent's tale shatters love's illusions; the fortuneteller's shocking pronouncements toll the tedium and secret dread of every person's life; sensual undercurrents pour forth for men and women alike; and the dead walk again.Dazzling and macabre, literary and philosophical, The Circus of Dr. Lao has been acclaimed as a masterpiece of speculative fiction and influencedsuch writers as Ray Bradbury.

Sometimes you read the book and discover it was written from the movie and contains nothing extra.I bought the book because I loved the movie and wanted to know where the story came from.I read the book in one sitting last night (or should I say this morning). I was very disappointed.The book does introduce various characters, similar to ones in the movie. It does fill in the background of the various characters and how they decide to attend the circus.The Book as compared to the Movie...In the movie, the appearance of Dr Lao corresponds with a crucial decision point for the inhabitants of the town. What the citizens learn from the circus allows them to make an enlightened decision and Dr Lao ends up the hero. The characters in the movie have plot interaction that are influenced by the temptations of power and greed. As the plot unfolds, various people learn important things about themselves and improve their interpersonal situations, as well as the wellbeing of the town by the end of the movie. Doctor Lao appears to be an immortal character wanting to be a friend to the city, and humans in general.In the book, There is nothing particular going on in the town that the Dr's arrival changes. He comes to town, is very strange, puts the people into shock by showing them a very dark version of a witches sabbath, and subsequently, a ritual sacrifice to an idol. But there is no point being made that applies to the residents of the town, other that they wander away in shock, and the end of the sacrifice is the end of the movie, with no description of the reaction of the people after the circus.Movie divergence from the book...The addition of romance between important characters in the story, and the addition of a villain and a hero, gives an ongoing context to the story that is lacking from the book. The exact nature of the creatures and their roles in the circus change in the movie, but for the better I think. Also darker parts of the book, which didn't contribute to the plot in a meaningful way, have been translated for the movie into analogues more understandable in the current time and place.I don't recommend the book, but rather highly recommend the movie which is very enjoyable, and very much G rated.\"}"}]}

Grant"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"description\": \"The complete personal memoirs of the 18th President of the United States and chief Union General during the American Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant.\", \"authors\": \"['Ulysses S. Grant']\", \"publisher\" : \"nan\", \"text\" : \"Ulysses S. Grant like many other Civil War figures wrote a long and detailed memoir detailing his experiences in the war. Unlike many of the others however, he did it not to toot his own horn but for the noble purpose of leaving an income for his family. One of the most famous pictures of Grant is the one of him sitting on his porch, covered in blankets, writing. He died just a week after he finished this book. I wonder if the Grant family is still receiving royalties from this book after all of these years.In reading this book one has to take into account that by his own admission, Grant was not a scholar. Nor was he a writer, but for a sick old soldier he does a wonderful job. The writing is a little dry at times but that is mainly because he goes into so much detail about his campaigns. His West Point eye shows not only in his strategy but also in his writing as he goes into great detail about the topography of the areas he is describing. In fact, this is the most dull part of the book as he goes into so much detail that he will occasionally lose the reader entirely. Grant is not one to cast blame for his problems but as part of his topographical discussions he almost always writes that this ground was much more favorable for defense, he of course being on the offensive. It is also easy to avoid casting blame for failures when the writer has few failures, so while Grant is not guilty of this he has no reason to be.Grant does not describe his battles in detail for some reason. His overall campaigns are covered in detail but the battles themselves get little attention. The battles of others under his command are told in a far more interesting and complete manner than are the battles he was personally involved in. His descriptions of Sherman's Atlanta campaign and the march to the sea are riveting and his descriptions of the final days of the war and Lee's surrender are enthralling. He also goes to great lengths to defend some of his comrades against charges that had been made against them while never taking on charges leveled at him. His drinking is never mentioned. He even takes time to defend Joe Johnston's Georgia campaign against Sherman. His insights are incredible but this memoir could have offered the reader a little more of a glimpse into the author than it does. Although, toward the end of the book one does start to see Grant's personality come out.There are numerous maps included in this book but they will be of little use to most readers. I assume they are military maps, but they are so detailed that one can hardly make out the important points. There is also an attempt to downplay what Robert E. Lee had accomplished before Grant arrived on the scene. This could have come from humility on Grant's part, or it could have been jealousy, but whatever the cause it is unseemly. Still, Grant knew how to defeat Lee and did so, which is more than any other Union general managed to do.Overall, this is a very insightful and well-written book. Any serious student of the Civil War will want to have a copy of their own, not only to read but as a very important reference book. He points out the mistakes and shortcomings of leaders on both sides as well as offers praise when he feels it is due. It is amazing how kind he is to General Halleck considering how much trouble that man caused Grant early in the war. He does seem to take delight however in detailing Sherman's dislike of Halleck. Not much of the real Grant comes across in this book but what does come through is that while he was a determined advisory; he was also a very kind hearted man. A great man in fact, who was very much misunderstood, then and now.\"}"}]}

The style is accessible and engaging, consistently interesting with well-reasoned arguments. Religions are not compared; the study is restricted to the experiences of the individual. It has nothing to do with churches, doctrine or dogma, concerning itself only with the religious experiences of everyday life.James considers the feelings, actions and experiences of people insofar as they understand themselves to be in a relationship with whatever they consider the Divine. He emphasizes the passionate aspect of religion and its power of adding enchantment to life. Dealing objectively with a wide spectrum of observed and personally related religious experiences, James also quotes from the autobiographical writings of famous authors, theologians and mystics from many traditions including Whitman, Luther, Voltaire, Emerson, Tolstoy and many others.The terrain of study is clearly identified and circumscribed. Chapter titles include Religion & Neurology, the Reality of the Unseen, the Religion of Healthy-Mindedness, the Sick Soul, the Divided Self & the Process of Unification, Conversion, Saintliness, Mysticism and Philosophy. This book offers a treasure trove of insights, revelation, wisdom and points to ponder that contributes substantially to the reader's understanding of consciousness, psychological processes, mystic states, thought & emotion, and the relationship to the Eternal Divine.In his own words: \"Both thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct may be determined either by feeling or thought. When we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have prevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian and Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories which religion generates, being thus variable, are secondary. If you wish to grasp its essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct as being the more constant elements.\"Although it is not a difficult text to grasp, patience is called for since every sentence is loaded with so many layers of meaning that one often has to reread a previous paragraph in order to fully comprehend and properly process the insights and information. A mindful, meditative study of the text will richly reward the reader.Chapter 14 ofCracking the Bible Codeby Jeffrey Satinover contains interesting information on William James and his views on freedom of choice within deterministic influences. Other works on religion and/or spirituality that I have found illuminating, inspiring or thought-provoking areBible Mystery and Bible Meaning&The Creative Process in the Individualby Thomas Troward,Religion in the Makingby Alfred North Whitehead,The Hidden Power of the Bibleby Ernest Holmes,Alter Your Lifeby Emmet Fox,The Thirteen Petalled Roseby Adin Steinsaltz andOne Cosmos Under Godby Robert Godwin.\"}"}]}

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O\u2019Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut\u2019s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as \u201cthe kind of writer who made people\u2014young people especially\u2014want to write.\u201d George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be \u201cthe great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.\u201d Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era\u2019s uncertainties. \u201cPoignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.\u201d\u2014The Boston Globe\", \"authors\": \"['Kurt Vonnegut']\", \"publisher\" : \"Dial Press Trade Paperback\", \"text\" : \"There are two words to describe this book: weird and wonderful. You could substitute \"quirky\" for weird if you want, because that's what \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is: a very quirky, oddball adventure through time and space. And it contains a valuable message if you decide to believe in the Tralfamadore view of things. I rather like their perspective that because someone was alive at some point then they are ALWAYS living, at least somewhere. (Though I suppose it's only comforting when you apply that to good people, because that definition also means that Hitler and other evildoers are always living somewhere too.)The novel begins with the author struggling to find a way to tell the story of his experience in World War II as a prisoner of war and witness to the firebombing of Dresden, which took more lives (at least immediately) than the atomic bomb. He visits a friend and finally turns in a jumbled-up mess to the publisher.This jumbled-up mess is the story of Billy Pilgrim who is (or thinks he is) unstuck in time. Because of this, his life is in shuffle mode, so to speak, where he randomly shifts from one point in time to another. At one point he might be standing in a field in Germany during the war, at another he's talking to the Lions club in upstate New York, and at another he's a baby in his mother's arms. Told chronologically, Billy enters the war near the end, gets captured, witnesses the bombing of Dresden, gets repatriated after the war, marries a large, rich woman named Valencia, has a couple kids, runs a successful optometry business, and gets taken to the Tralfamadore homeworld to be put in a zoo with a porn star. Billy even sees how he is going to die.If the book were related chronologically and if Vonnegut didn't have such a way with language--his sentences lack poetic prose, but have the same quirky, seemingly random rhythm as the plot--then this book wouldn't have been nearly as interesting. The way it's jumbled up forces the reader to keep putting the pieces together, although Vonnegut has a tendency to over-foreshadow some things like the teapot incident. And the style makes reading a breeze because it's very relatable for the average vocabulary--no big words to confuse people.The only real flaw is the overuse of the expression \"so it goes\" to mark anytime a person, place, or thing dies. Wikipedia's article on the book says there are 106 references. It seemed like many more. I understand what Vonnegut was going for, but it did get irritating before long.I should warn you, though, that even if the sentences are easy to read, you do need to be the type of reader who can put up with the quirky nature of the book to read it. So it's not recommended to everyone. If you're up to putting together a puzzle and like a little sci-fi with your literature, then you'll be fine. Maybe you won't agree with Vonnegut and the Tralfamadore's view of the universe--maybe you like to believe in free will--but you should still be able to appreciate what a creative feat this book was and what a great author wrote it.That is all.\"}"}]}

One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once.

Pratchett does an excellent job of revealing the importance, and at the same time the absurdity, of the role of media in everyday life. What mostly comes across is the humor, and it is done well. A story develops which places the newspaper at odds with governmental order, when an investigation seems to lead to political corruption surrounding the circumstances of Lord Vetinari's imprisonment. Some of the usual cast of characters make appearances, and there is plentiful entertainment. The Watch (Discworld police) have a substatial role in the book, and unfortunately they are not as entertaining as some of the other characters. They were needed for the story, and they filled the need. The story, in fact, worked mostly to hold all the humorous observations together. I expected an effective blending of the ingredients, and instead was aware of each as separate elements.I've read a number of Pratchett's books now, and I'm a solid fan. For me they work best when Pratchett weaves together dimensional characters, a plot that allows the characters and the satire to blossom, and at least some emphasis on important human issues to help lift the books above only humor and entertainment. The material Pratchett chose here could have landed squarely on target on all counts. Instead, it broke into several pieces upon landing, and some of the pieces rolled harmlessly away. Humor strikes the bullseye, and saves the day.\"}"}]}

The only chapter written with much enthusiasm is about her 25th wedding anniversary party given by Sinatra in Vegas. But she then talks about how much she and her husband are apart--and how they allow a man who has been in love with her for decades to move into their house while the husband is gone. Few other personal details other than saying she and her husband fought a lot.She also takes a lot of credit for Auntie Mame. It's hard to say if she's being honest about how much input she had into all aspects of the original stage production, but she acts as if she almost single-handedly made a variety of decisions that turned it into a hit.Her lack of movie-making stories is truly disappointing. She should have some really interesting stories of working with famous directors and stars--but she barely even mentions some of her works. My favorite is The Trouble With Angels, which she dismisses as \"the nun movie\" and only devotes a couple sentences to it even though she devoted two years of her life to the film and its sequel!

Whether it's school woes, health issues, boy troubles, or simply feeling lost, the March sisters all need the same thing: support from each other. Only by coming together--and sharing lots of laughs and tears--will these four young women find the courage to discover who they truly are as individuals...and as a family. Meg is the eldest March, and she has a taste for the finer things in life. She dreams of marrying rich, enjoying fabulous clothes and parties, and leaving her five-floor walk-up apartment behind. Jo pushes her siblings to be true to themselves, yet feels like no one will accept her for who she truly is. Her passion for writing gives her an outlet to feel worthy in the eyes of her friends and family. Beth is the shy sister with a voice begging to be heard.

Door een zeldzame ziekte kan hij zonlicht niet verdragen en leeft hij zijn leven wanneer iedereen slaapt. Hij besluit in het holst van de nacht op zoek te gaan naar de vermiste kinderen in de donkere kelders van Fort Wyvern. Er gaan geruchten dat hier ondraaglijke experimenten worden uitgevoerd. Is hij opgewassen tegen de gevaren van genetische manipulatie? De horrorthriller \u2018Grijp de nacht\u2019 is het tweede verhaal over Christopher Snow, waarmee bestsellerauteur Dean Koontz je opnieuw de stuipen op het lijf weet te jagen. Moonlight Bay is een onafgeronde trilogie van Dean Koontz. Christopher Snow, een man met een bijzondere genetische huidziekte, onderzoekt mysterieuze gebeurtenissen rond de fictieve Californische plaats Moonlight Bay. Liefhebbers van de eerste twee boeken wachten al sinds het jaar 2000 op het derde deel in de serie, dat half af zou zijn, maar moeten het vooralsnog met twee delen stellen: Vrees niets en Grijp de nacht. De Amerikaanse auteur Dean Ray Koontz (1945) staat bekend om zijn spannende thrillers die vaak een vleugje horror, fantasy, science fiction of satire bevatten. Veel van zijn werken bereikten de New York Times-bestsellerlijst, waarvan meerdere direct op nummer \u00e9\u00e9n binnenkwamen. Dit maakt hem tot een van de grootste New York Times-bestsellerauteurs ter wereld. In totaal heeft hij maar liefst 105 boeken geschreven waarvan er meer dan zestig in het Nederlands te lezen zijn.

We go from there to an uneasy feeling that not everything's as it should be. Then things start to get slightly skewed with the protagonists feeling just a little nervous. They don't know exactly what's wrong, but something's not right. Finally, all hell breaks loose and you are left with no doubt that you have just passed into Stephen King's realm, and through all the unreality, you still get the faint glimmer that this impossible situation just could be possible. We're faced with aliens in the woods, a possible threat to humanity and average guys who, on the surface, aren't really equipped for the fight.You will probably want to read this book if: - You're a Stephen King fan who really enjoyed The Tommyknockers. - You want to read a new explanation for all of those supposed UFO sightings over the years. -You enjoy epic, save-the-world stories that, let's face it, could never happen - could they?You probably won't want to read this book if: - You didn't enjoy The Tommyknockers. - You like the action at a sustained fast-pace. The book does tend to lose momentum mid-way through. - You have a thing about profanity.Although the story is rather formulaic, this formula is the reason I read Stephen King books.\"}"}]}

In the spring of 2004, graphic photographs of Iraqi prisoners being tortured by American soldiers in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison flashed around the world, provoking outraged debate. Did they depict the rogue behavior of \"a few bad apples\"? Or did they in fact reveal that the US government had decided to use brutal tactics in the \"war on terror\"? The images are shocking, but they do not tell the whole story. The abuses at Abu Ghraib were not isolated incidents but the result of a chain of deliberate decisions and failures of command. To understand how \"Hooded Man\" and \"Leashed Man\" could have happened, Mark Danner turns to the documents that are collected for the first time in this book. These documents include secret government memos, some never before published, that portray a fierce argument within the Bush administration over whether al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners were protected by the Geneva Conventions and how far the US could go in interrogating them. There are also official reports on abuses at Abu Ghraib by the International Committee of the Red Cross, by US Army investigators, and by an independent panel chaired by former defense secretary James R. Schlesinger. In sifting this evidence, Danner traces the path by which harsh methods of interrogation approved for suspected terrorists in Afghanistan and Guant\u2021namo \"migrated\" to Iraq as resistance to the US occupation grew and US casualties mounted. Yet as Mark Danner writes, the real scandal here is political: it \"is not about revelation or disclosure but about the failure, once wrongdoing is disclosed, of politicians, officials, the press, and, ultimately, citizens to act.\" For once we know the story the photos and documents tell, we are left with the questions they pose for our democratic society: Does fighting a \"new kind of war\" on terror justify torture? Who will we hold responsible for deciding to pursue such a policy, and what will be the moral and political costs to the country?\", \"authors\": \"['Mark Danner']\", \"publisher\" : \"New York Review of Books\", \"text\" : \"Movies have separate ratings for violence, sexual content or language, so should books. Mark Danner's \"Torture and Truth\" deserves separate consideration. The book is a singular reference for the academic or historian who will try to make sense of an age when Americans acted out of fear instead of strength and confidence, and became the world's bully instead of its protector. As such, this is not for the reader who wants to be entertained. The detailed memoranda that describe intradepartmental and interdepartmental conflict will prevent that, so will the myriad of abbreviations and acronyms that will make the reader turn to the appendix again and again. A few readers will be lucky enough to know what sigint, UCMJ or CSM mean without seeking clarification, but the constant turn to the appendix will cause frustration and disrupt the continuity of reading.What becomes apparent is that torture was considered even before we started taking prisoners or that there was \"actionable intelligence\" to be gained from them. Colin Powel's State Department sends a flurry of memoranda attempting to convince the Bush administration to act within the rules of the Geneva Convention. The Departments of Justice and Defense, the Office of Legal Counsel, and Bush's own lawyer write the opposite. The forces against Powell are strong. Afghanistan is declared a failed state, the Geneva Convention will be observed but not practiced, and torture is given such a narrow definition as to allow almost any practice short of permanent injury or death.What doesn't need to be looked at in detail are the pictures of Americans acting as barbarians. It is obvious from the photographs that they were not seeking intelligence information by sitting on top of nude prisoners, torturing them in hallways, putting them on a leash, making one prisoner fellate another, stacking them nude, in human pyramids, or tying them to beds or cell doors while they were also nude. Smiling faces of American women over an Iraqi corpse may sicken the viewer almost as much as seeing the hooded man, standing on a box, believing that electrodes are clipped to his fingers. These are photos of Americans as einsatzgrppe.The sworn statements from prisoners and the February 2004 Report of the International Red Cross show a pattern of brutality in too many facilities to be considered isolated incidents committed by \"bad apples.\" \"Certain Coalition Forces military intelligence officers told the ICRC that in their estimate between 70% and 90%of the persons deprived of their liberty in Iraq had been arrested by mistake.\"The Taguba, Fay, and Schlessinger Investigations point to a lack of leadership, command and control, logistics, training, and continuity to explain the mayhem that resulted, but no investigation is aimed at the decision-makers in Washington. Prisoners are not taken to the rear as doctrine called for because the rising insurgency means there is no rear and no central point to process detainees who exchange number and identification with each other. Soldiers operating under the dilemma of using harsh techniques to provide intelligence and act humanely were given no moral compass by leadership or command and control. In other words, who was in charge? Those who were well-led, knew SOP and policy acted professionally. Some officers, NCO's and enlisted men made it their mission to act professionally, but only some.The U. S. does not plan for combat operations in Iraq to end as quickly as it does. It expects to turn over Iraq to a sycophant who turns out to be a double agent. The U. S. doesn't, and stays. Neither event is planned for. The administration is unprepared for an occupation, an occupation that has no front line, plenty of time for things to turn for the worse, and not enough troops to handle it when it does.It is also apparent that America had come full circle since 1945. It had become the invader instead of the liberator. It had become the brute and the bully instead of the protector. It now leads other nations through domination and coercion, instead of by example and cooperation.This book was written in 2004. To date, no national policymaker has been held accountable for what happened.\"}"}]}

As she unfolds the story of Undine Spragg, from New York to Europe, Wharton affords us a detailed glimpse of what might be called the interior d\u00e9cor of this America and its nouveau riche fringes. Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine's marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted.

Her writing sings, and the stories she tells are steeped in a keen understanding of human nature. Undine is perhaps one of the most vivid characters ever to appear on the page. Her struggles, mostly of her own making, make us wince, even as we turn the pages as fast as we can to see what she'll be up to next. If timelessness is what makes something literature, then this is a literary work of the highest order. The tragedy is of Shakespearean dimensions, even though Undine is, in many ways, very little, though she wants nothing more than to be big, in all the wrong ways and for all the wrong reasons. The Wall Street shenanigans, along with Undine's social climbing, make this book feel as relevant today as it was when written. I can't help but think about how brave Wharton was, to skewer her own social class even as she participated in it. I can't wait to read a Wharton bio.

I think that there is yet more to be said. Strauss as a political philosopher argued the case that with Machiavelli modern political thought begins. One cannot help when reading the Hiero to begin to see further, it was already convincingly argued in Thoughts on Machiavelli, how Machiavelli's famous treatise The Prince is in many ways a response to this dialogue from Xenophon. The discussion of tyranny and the &quot;joys&quot; and &quot;protections&quot; that stem from such a life are questioned in the Hiero because of the ramifications of tyrannic rule. Strauss, in typical fashion, articulates and expands on the argument presented in the Hiero. The responses from Kojeve bring the classical into conflict with the most progressive of modern thought, the concept of the universal state. Particularly valuable in this edition is the collection of the correspondence of the two respondents which clarify, and present a more honest argument, the public discourse extant in the formal essays. Read this book as a companion to &quot;The Prince&quot; or studies of Hegel to see the dialogue between &quot;Classical&quot; and &quot;Modern&quot; or even &quot;Post-modern&quot; thought.\"}"}]}

Reissue.\", \"authors\": \"['George Eliot']\", \"publisher\" : \"Penguin\", \"text\" : \"Silas Marner spends his days weaving for the village-folk of Raveloe, weaving and saving, hiding his money in leather bags in the floor of his home. At nights, he counts the money, tinkling it between his hands, memorising the increasing total. He spends little, and has no friends or family. His life consists of waiting to leave his life, an endless weave that seems to have no beginning and no end.But Silas was not always a weaver. As a young man, he was engaged, and living in another town. But his best friend, William Dane, who was jealous of his good fortune and hopeful prospects, engendered a plan to strip Silas of everything he held dear. His hometown, convinced he was involved with the robbery of a senior deacon, accused him of theft and he was forced to leave. He stumbles upon Raveloe and begins to weave, and fifteen years past.It is to George Eliot's credit that a story with such fairy tale qualities is so successful. From the very beginning we are made aware of character-types and ideas, with Silas being an innocent man wrongly accused, and then, as a weaver, a giant metaphor of toil and struggle in an unfair world. The townsfolk of Raveloe, as they are outlined, remain simply that - a thick line that purports to show the broad details of a person, but in no way offers the subtle shading that makes a character come to life and become a person. But this is to the story's credit, for we are not interested so much in depth of character and complexity of situation, as we are in the constant weaving, the endless sadness, of Silas Marner's self-imposed exile.While we learn of Marner's new life as a hoarder, a miser, a weaver, we come to see other characters and situations. There is a young man, Godfrey, who is running out of money and seeks a desperate measure to fix his worries. There is his father, who disapproves of his life and choices. One New Year's, the two stories intersect, and after Silas is robbed of all his money, a young girl, blonde and innocent and nameless, is found on his doorstep. Her mother, an opium addict, is discovered nearby, frozen to death. A father, if there is one, does not step forward.Here, Eliot allows us to know the secret well before Silas or Eppie, his newly christened adopted daughter. Godfrey is the father, and it is a secret he carries with him well past necessary. His duplicitous action is flagged at a very early stage, which sets in our mind the idea that a comeuppance, or a truth revealing set piece, is somewhere along the line. Because this is known - for what fairy tale does not, in the end, end in goodness and retribution and justice for those who deserve it? - we are able to enjoy the experience of Silas as he becomes a good father, and learns how to love.In a sense, the themes surrounding Silas are trite and over-used. The idea of a sad, lonely man discovering the beauty of the world again through love, is nothing new. Yet Eliot's mastery of character and evocation of place allow us to sail along with Silas as he sheds the hard carapace of armour that he has placed around himself. He becomes, as we do, devoted to Eppie. She is a caricature, a purely good and ultimately pure girl who, through the tutelage of her father, understands the meaning of love even where Godfrey, her real father, does not.Eliot makes heavy use of dialect in Silas Marner. As a personal taste, I distinctly dislike dialect, because I find I spend more time translating what is being said than enjoying and understanding the character as they are presented. Yes, it can aid in characterisation and 'realism', but at what cost? Much like Wuthering Heights, several characters in Silas Marner were ruined for me, purely because I had to work so hard at what they were saying. And of course, upon figuring out their obscure words, I realised that they were saying nothing meaningful at all. A great disappointment, that.Throughout, various characters are introduced and then pushed to the background, as needed by the story. When Silas is in difficulties concerning the raising of a child, a goodwife is found, Dolly Winthrop, who provides him with advice and stresses that the child must be christened. Later, a love interest is given to Eppie, because what happy ending does not finish with a wedding?But these are minor quibbles. As a fairy tale, Silas Marner excels. There are good people done wrong, and bad people who come right in the end. There is a happy - or mostly happy - ending for everyone who deserves it, and a few that don't. But more than that, there is the construction of a wholly sympathetic man, and that is Silas Marner himself. Eliot does not stray down an easy route with him - when he becomes a miser, there is sadness, not avarice, in our minds as we sympathise.This novel is considered minor Eliot; it is not hard to fault that estimation. Middlemarch is a towering literary achievement, whereas Silas Marner is merely a single flower in a garden of like experiments with words. But what flower does not deserve to be smelled, at least once?\"}"}]}

William Golding\u2019s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L.

It completely demonstrated a unique and interesting plot. School boys are forced to live by themselves because a plane crashed on an island. There are so many ideas that could be thought of with this one situation. The author created this situation and developed it into a made up society of kids who try to work together but end up turning against one another. It is a totally realistic way of describing this rare, fictitious occasion. I liked how there was an unexpected twist of Simons death after he realizes that there is no beast and that the beast is a fear within everyone. Ralph showed many leadership qualities as he instructed everyone to do the right thing and maintain their signal for help. Jack is entirely against him and wants to hunt to stay alive instead of follow Ralph's commands. This creates the dysfunction among the boys which is the worst thing that could happen. I could tell at the beginning that Piggy a target since he was previously picked on and was portrayed as fat. He is later killed by the other tribe. I thought the end was somewhat predictable. I had a sense that they would be saved sooner or later. The officer ends up coming to their rescue.\"}"}]}

Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humor, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment.

K. Chesterton\u2019s poem \u201cThe English Graves,\u201d serves for Richard M. Gamble as an interpretive key to a peculiarly important moment in American history: the time of the First World War, when progressive Christian leaders in America transformed themselves from principled pacifists to crusading interventionists. The consequence of this momentous shift, says Gamble, was the triumph of the idea that America has been destined by divine Providence to bring salvation to the less enlightened nations of the world. In The War for Righteousness, Gamble reconstructs the inner world of the social gospel clergy, tracing the evolution of the clergy\u2019s interventionist ideology from its roots in earlier efforts to promote a modern, activist Christianity. He shows how these clergy eventually came to see their task as world evangelization for the new creed of democracy and internationalism, and ultimately for the redemption of civilization itself through the agency of total war. World War I thus became a transcendent moment of fulfillment. In the eyes of the progressive clergy, the years from 1914 to 1918 presented an unprecedented opportunity to achieve their vision of a world transformed\u2014the ancient dream of a universal and everlasting kingdom of peace, justice, and righteousness. American sacrifice was necessary not only to save the country, but to save the entire world. Vividly narrating how the progressive clergy played a surprising role in molding the public consensus in favor of total war, Gamble engages the broader question of religion\u2019s role in shaping the modern American mind and the development, at the deepest levels, of the logic of messianic interventionism both at home and abroad. This timely book not only fills a significant gap in our collective memory of the Great War, it also helps demonstrate how and why that war heralded the advent of a different American self-understanding.\", \"authors\": \"['Richard M.

One of the siblings first discovers way into Narnia through the wardrobe Professor Kirke made out of Narnian wood at the end of the Magician's Nephew. Eventually,all 4 of the siblings find their way into Narnia and the story really begins. The plot is graver and the tone grimmer than the Magician's Nephew. In this book the 4 siblings find Narnia an unhappy land annd will also find themselves in real danger. The adventure is about how the siblings,with the help of Aslan,put things right in the land of Narnia. There are two things I particulary like about the Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe. 1st,The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe makes the Magician's Nephew an even stronger story than it was to begib with because of connections between the stories. There were many times while reading The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe that I found myself saying \"Oh,yeah,because in the Magician's Nephew................. Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows made Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince a stronger story,so too The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe made the Magician's Nephew a stronger story. Now we've got a strong series going. I also loved the fact that the people that got into Narnia from \"our world\" in The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe were different humans than the ones in the Magician's Nephew. I love how Lewis expanded his base of characters with this book. One last thing is that I LOVED the \"gifts\" part. (Can't say more than gifts,it'd require a big spoiler.) The biggest waekness of The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is that the physical appearance of Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy is never described so you have to guess. (I now think of the characters from the movie when I think about what they would look like.) The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material.\"}"}]}

Leave aside the constant inconsistencies in their behaviour and the ridiculous unreality of the situations they find themselves in. Even leave aside the loud grinding of machinery heard throughout, as the author laboriously winches the pieces into place for the next piece of utterly implausible 'slapstick' comedy. The real question is, what is the reader supposed to take away from all this? Are we supposed to sympathise with the odious Reilly? What point is the author trying to convey? As the heading says, beats me.In the final analysis, do any of the characters learn anything? Do they grow and develop? Has there been some unifying meaning to their experiences?

First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time. In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today. With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of \u201cChristianities\u201d emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment\u2014and access to God\u2014within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary\u2014or worthy\u2014expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed\u2014and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.\", \"authors\": \"['Elaine Pagels']\", \"publisher\" : \"Random House\", \"text\" : \"Elaine Pagels is a highly reputed scholar who has devoted a lifetime to the study of the Nag Hammadi. In this very accessible yet detailed account, Pagels examines four basic principles of Christianity--the Resurrection, the Crucifixion, the notion of the church, and the role of women--and explains the alternative views of these issues presented in these &quot;hidden&quot; writings. Gnosticism was a less-centralized, more mystical approach to Christianity that emphasized the search for truth and knowledge in oneself. For this reason, gnostics disagreed that bishops and priests were the source of truth and that the Church was the path to Salvation. Gnostics were likely to have several different interpretations of an event like the Resurrection, and viewed all of these as legitimate paths to the true meaning. Gnostics also were more likely to recognize the feminine aspects of spirituality and give women a greater role in worship.Many of these beliefs were labeled as heresy by the mainstream church and the gnostics were slowly supplanted by the Orthodox Christians. Pagels speculates at length on why the more mainstream beliefs won out, based upon the culture and politics of the time. These considerations in her view dictated which writings became the New Testament and which were repressed.What is striking about this book is that the view of gnosticism Pagels presents seems very modern--the search for truth as an individual quest, the importance of women and their role, the rejection of hierarchy that has become so problematic in the modern Catholic Church. One wonders what would have happened if the decisions on which texts were correct and which were heresy had come out differently.Pagels nevertheless views the establishment of the hierarchical Church as a positive development, and wonders if Christianity would have survived if the more mystical, less structured, individualized gnostic approach had won out. I'm not so sure--many of the world's great religions--Buddhism is a notable example--have survived for thousands of years in just this form. Pagels book is thought-provoking and extremely valuable for any student of Christianity, no matter where your personal views lie.\"}"}]}

It was subsequently revised and expanded as a result of Nakamura's interaction with a number of prominent Western scholars such as Yale's Arthur F. Wright (Buddhism in Chinese History, 1959), and Hawaii's Philip O. Wiener, who edited the revised English translation published by the University of Hawaii Press in 1964.In his preface to the 1960 edition Wright describes Nakamura's project: \". . . No people in the world today is isolated from those world-wide movements of thought and belief which are tending to transform the lives of all peoples. But each people accepts or rejects, adapts and modifies the universal ideologies which reach them. What governs this process, and what is it which produces within each culture an amalgam which is at once part of a world-wide movement and distinctively its own? Mr. Nakamura considers the spread of the universal religion of Buddhism; and in Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan responses to Buddhism -- as well as in the history of Buddhism in India -- Mr. Nakamura finds clues to certain fundamental and persisting characteristics of their differing modes of thought. These characteristics in turn help to explain their fundamental historical and cultural differences one from another and their variant responses to Western culture in our time.\"Ways of Thinking is subdivided into four major parts: INDIA, CHINA, TIBET, and JAPAN; and it may be helpful to point out that Professor Nakamura's wide range of interests and study qualified him to attempt such an ambitious project -- as indicated by the fact that early in his career he was awarded a special prize for his four volume history of early (Indian) Vedanta philosophy.Perhaps some sense of the issues and problems involved in Ways of Thinking can be gleaned from the table of contents for the section on Japan. It must be noted, however, that these not sound-bites to conjure up a social stereotype. Rather, they are serious topics which Professor Nakamura addresses at length with many examples and notes. And we are free to agree or disagree with his conclusions only after we have carefully read what he has to say.PART IV: JAPAN34.
